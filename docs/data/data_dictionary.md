# Data Dictionary

This project uses a pretty simple dataset structure, which uses only two variables: the target (the artist name) and the predictor (their lyrics of their songs).

# Lyrics.txt

This database is the collection of all the lyrics available for a limited set of artists associated with the Rock genre. It's divided by artist and song. Each artist have up to 25 songs and will be in raw format. Once made the data preprocessing, the table should have this format: 

## Table 1

Here you must describe the table

| column | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artist | STR | Artist name |
| Songs  | STR | All the songs of the artist will be joined in a corpus for each artist |
