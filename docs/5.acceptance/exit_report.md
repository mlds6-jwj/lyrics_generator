# Exit Report of Project <X> for Customer <Y>

Customer: Juan Sebastian Lara, Melissa de la Pava

Team Members: William Agudelo (PM), Juan Carranza, Juan Munoz, Jaime Vera (Data Scientists)

##	Overview
We created a deep learning model that provide lyrics generation in the various rock subgenres. 
This model allows getting generation of lyrics with only a couple of words that provide some context to the model. 
In addition to the deployment with Flask with just a few clicks our client can access this solution.

##	Business Domain
Music production industry.

##	Business Problem
Lyrics creation.

##	Data Processing
We performed typical text processing techniques such as tokenizing, lemmatizing, removing stop words and other undesired elements of the text.

##	Modeling, Validation
We conducted a procedure in the training process that allowed us to validate this predictions, getting the best possible model with our configuration.

##	Solution Architecture
This architecture followed many models of text prediction, which are famous by the fact that they only need a simple input and can provide large text predictions.

##	Benefits
	
###	Company Benefit (internal only. Double check if you want to share this with your customer)
Now, our customer can quickly interact with this solution and get more ideas in the lyrics creation.

###	Customer Benefit
Our client can save time creating lyrics and by doing so, producing more efficiently.

##	Learnings

### 	Project Execution
Text predictions using deep learning is definitely a fruitful way to get better results compared to the typical machine learnings models.

### Data science / Engineering
Having a very organized repository clearly defines how quickly the project can achieve their goals and deadlines.


### Domain
After doing EDA on our dataset, we found that despite the fact we used only Rock music as input for the model, there are Rock artists that produce lyrics, which are in very isolated clusters. Then, being aware of this issue is crucial.

### Product
The more easy and simple the tool is, the more the client will use it.

###	What's unique about this project, specific challenges
Provides text prediction for a very specific genre, instead of trying to encompass so much.

##	Next Steps
Now, we need to check how the lyrics quality has changed by the use of our tool.
