# Infrastructure

In this project we use two types of tools:
- Github repository (for development)
- Python and libraries for Natural Language Processing:
	- Pandas 
	- Numpy 
	- Sklearn 
	- Tensorflow 
	- Keras 
	- Collections 
	- Re (expresiones regulares) 
	- NLTK
	- Plotly 
	- Matplotlib
	- Profanity

The model was initially developed based on a lyrics database acquired through an API from [genius.com](genius.com). 
The project provides an API key, for future database updates.
If it is necessary or undesirable, you can acquire a new API use key, registering as a development user at [genius.com](genius.com).

Regarding the hardware infrastructure, a development environment type Google colab with GPU availability was used.
