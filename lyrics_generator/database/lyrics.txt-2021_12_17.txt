 Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the dead painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

Oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone on the stage
My little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
Open-eyed, burn the page
My little dark age
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone
Horrified on the stage
My little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge
Bring a stone, all the rage
My little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
Open-eyed, burn the page
My little dark age

All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age77EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

You were a child crawling on your knees toward it
Making mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm, but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

Control yourself, take only what you need from it

 All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
I was standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

Oh, you can do it all the time

 I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?
Forget about our mothers and our friends

We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end

 Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out

In every scene, it's me and Michael
Imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds
So it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die
When all the best and brightest have gone

Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael

Binary stars sink, like the setting sun
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
So you think, the losing side would never break dividing lines
But sanctity wasn't in doubt

Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now

 Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells

Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple
As people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard

But I've got someone to make reports
That tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds
So I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast
But I tied my boots to a broken mast

The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste
But damn my﻿ luck and damn these friends
That keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt
And lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up congratulations6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Alright, here we go!
Five, four, three, two, and one
Are you ready to work out?

Don't take it the wrong way

Sick of liking your selfies
Should've gone with my gut
Maybe I'm in a movie
Maybe I'm out to lunch
But I'm constantly swiping and tapping
It's never relaxing, I need a new routine

 Evil $, I, yes, to find a shore
A beast that doesn't quiver anymore
And we could crush some plants to paint my walls
And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars
Was I? I was too lazy to bathe
Or paint or write or try to make a change
Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch
And I don't have to love or think too much

Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk
Mental mystics in a twisted metal car
Tried to amplify the sound of light and love

Christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs
Might even take a knife to split a hair
Or even scare the children off my lawn
Giving us time to make the makeshift bombs
Every mess invested was a score
We couldn't use computers anymore
But it's difficult to win unless you're bored
And you might have to plan for the weekend wars

Try to break my heart, I'll drive to Arizona
It might take a hundred years to grow an arm
I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior (huh!)
My predictions are the only things I have
I can amplify the sound of light and love
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win
I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win
I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound
When I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win
I don't know how to begin

 Mild apprehension
Blank dreams of the coming fun
Distort the odds of a turnaround
Gut screams out next to none
So turn it on, tune it in
And stay inert
You say, "I've got the backbone"
The back way to escape the gun
Climbing a tree with a missing limb
And not saving anyone
And now it hurts to stay at home
And see flash

The mirror ball's throwing mold
And you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold
You see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt
And if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt
Plants, as far as I know are still
Still bending toward the light
And if we dance until the heart explodes
It will make this place ignite
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope
It's just a case of flash delirium
Here's a growing culture deep inside a corpse
Ages stuck together, taking it to the source
Timeless desperation, pictures on a screen scream
"Hey, people, what does it mean?"
Comfort keeps us nice
So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives)
Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen)
And time's tingling spines
Attaching hands to floor
The rosy-tinted flash

The hot dog's getting cold
And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones
Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt
Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt
Lines when I close my eyes and just (Why close one eye and try to)
Aim blindly at the sun (Pledge allegiance to the sun)
And hear love when the ghosts start singing
(When plastic ghosts start terrorizing everyone)
Terrorizing everyone
And (geometric troops aligning)
(Carried up to the burial mounds) with gold
It's a heavy time but your (My earthbound heart is heavy)
Your rhythm makes it light (Your heartbeat keeps things light)
And explode like a violent star keeps (With the violence forever)
(Threatening the night)
And (even if this hall collapses)
(I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust)
That our heads won't bust
66 55 red battleships
40 earthlike planets
3 holes 2 tits
1 fork in its side
Zero tears in their eyes
Sue the spiders, sink the Welsh
Stab your Facebook, sell, sell, sell
Undercooked, overdone
Mass adulation not so funny
Poisoned honey, pseudo-science
Silly money, you're my honey!13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 On my phone

Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I try to pull the curtains back
Turn you off but can't detach
When all I want and all I know
Is time spent looking at my phone
(On my phone)

Find me when the lights go down
Signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home
Find me staring at my phone
I'm wondering where the hours went
As I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow
Time spent looking at my phone

Last thing that you need
Is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared
Devoured by perverted creatures
Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones
(On my phone)
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I call you, you don't call me back
Almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan
Time spent looking at my phone

Clouds are getting full
So you close all the windows
I would never let you die
Even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need
Is a way to remember
You can never find the time
If you spend everyday looking at your phone


You should come with me
We can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed
And then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again
You can go ahead and stop pretending
Doo doo doo doo doo...7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 The deals we made to shake things up
And the rights that they abused
Might just fuck us over
But the doors won't shut until they're sure
There's nothing left to use
Someone's taking over
Threw it away, but now I say
It's time to hand it over

The joke's worn thin, the king stepped in
Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over
But the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right
We both knew it was true
The smart ones exit early
And the rest hope for a shoulder

If we lose our touch, it won't mean much
If everyone's confused
Which door do we open?
It's the same old trick, they played their hand
Now there's one thing left to do
It’s time (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
One thing on my mind  (Hand it over)
It's rightfully mine (Hand it over)
In the dark (Hand it over)
What's yours is mine (Hand it over)
Mm, make it right (Hand it over)
And give me what's mine (Hand it over)

Oh, this time (Hand it over)
It's yours and mine (Hand it over)
Hey, it's time to hand it over
Just give me what's mine (Hand it over)

 Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear any more strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth


There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold, feel so cold


Balance the books, the ledges, the looms
The disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Spending the day, chewing at the fat
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough

Oh Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan, go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering

But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
Rolling away, missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel, but it's not a joke
Holding the line, clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right
It's not right
Smelling for blood, praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough

The low tide is telling me when it's over
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes


The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold


If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed

Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene

Forces you see breathe can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity

See if you can make it
Before you choose the night
And the silence overtakes you
If you looked into the fire
And you had that conversation
Then there's one thing left to try
If you want to save your life

Fear is his name, but his friends still call him God
Again and again, the thought remains
(The only way to get rid of the feeling)

I don't wanna die
Wishing I'd done something
More than what's required
To last until the sunset
No, I don't wanna die
Thinking that I'm dreaming
There's one thing left to try
If you want to change your life
Today I left those thoughts behind, behind
Over and over, you die just to feel alive

The only way to get rid of the feeling
You have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing
Decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?

 Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way
That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
Hey, one foot leads to another, night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers
Sequins in the eyes, that's a fine time to dine
Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Ooh, the alien days

Must've skipped the ship and joined the team for a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls and commandeer both my eyes
Hey! Be quick dear, times are uncertain, one month crawling, next year blurring
Decades in the drain, monograms on the brain
Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
Mmm...the alien days

When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty-ton stones for a mile
And in the summer, virgin visions, mindless humming
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile
Today, find infinite ways it could be plenty worse
It's a blessing but it's also a curse

Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling and when to let it go
How all the scheming, soulless creatures
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose
And when the light is new, the sky shows trembling cartoons
You don't need smoke to cover most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines
If it looks like we could lose

If it looks like we could lose

 In the afternoon
Yellow curtains drawn
Designed with comfort in mind
Glowering into the night
Feel like letting go
The final resting place
The house cat knows when it's time
To enter another phase

But you looked sad
In a reassuring way
And I don't want to leave
So we can both be the same

In the afternoon
Modern sovereignty
The sunlight stopped coming through
And we lost the game
Brains like nesting dolls
Plotting their escape
The doorman sees you're alone
He can't seem to find your name
But you, my friend
Know problems can't be solved
They don't understand
That somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same

Relief is like candy
The sweetest kind of love
Who'd guess that I'd feel this way?
Like a kid in a candy store

 Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?
Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
Unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray garden?
If your ship will never come, you gotta move along

Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn
And the bloodshed start the falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
If she's going under, I can hold my breath till the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat, rat, rat
He's a rat


To catch a monster, we make a movie
Set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance, half the motion
Communication is easy as the ocean20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Whenever I drift by the unknown
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine petals open and close offended
Poor explanation and nothing shown

Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we shared a dream for 20 nights in a row
I might feel better knowing that I was alone

Wherever scientists turn lead to birds
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking, they find amusing
Something else to soften a sadistic urge

When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core
Oh I'd twist it more

If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up
What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault)
Seeps into the hollow bones
Wouldn't its eyes expand and zero in like a scope
I might feel better knowing I wasn't alone5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 When you're big
And troubles seem so far
You put your belly up to the bar
Squint your eyes
You can almost miss the dirt
You tell yourself
It couldn't hurt

But when you're small
You can't walk down the hall
When you're small
You're not very big at all

When you're low
You reach a certain point
Where you can't really see the point
You can try
But, you can't see eye to eye
Yet when you're low then you really know

When you're high
It's easier to fight
When you're high
You don't have to know why
When you're small
You don't have very far to fall
When you're small
You feel like you belong
When you're small
You can curl into a ball
When you're small
No, you're not very big at all1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I like the line between your belly and your thighs
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The smell of your hair, the sparkle in your eyes
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The smoke in your breath, the breathing hard and heavy
The back of your neck, the shine on your Chevy
The moon was so big when I drove it to the levy, girl
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)

I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
And my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

The clean dreams, the sexy limousine
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
Jason's got the energy, he used to be a coke fiend
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The skinny brown arms coming out of your shirt
Heart is in the right place, brain is in the dirt
You live life like everyone's an enemy
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime

 So tired, soul searching
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find
That they were produced by Brian Eno
Past the gates, quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized, you'd probably know
He taught me many things
The wisdom of oblique stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Because if I was telling lies, it'd probably show
I can tell when he's kind of smiling
But what does he know? (What does he know?)

We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light
Dipping swords in metaphors, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)

We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

Well, all alone by the oldest stone where the shade trees grow
(What does he know?)
The creature by the water feature with the ghostly glow
(Brian Eno)
Making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)

We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Yeah, I can tell that he's doing well, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno

Yeah, he dips swords in metaphors yeah, but what does he know?

I'd like to see him plant a forest, because I don't know

I can tell that he's trying to smile, but what does he know?

 I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
People always told me, said "Don't forget your roots"
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
And you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
Get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

I was a loner, I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want, but it's you who's being used
Under your black eyes, honey, right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation, every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store
Little girl
You convince yourself that you want it
But you don't know
You keep trying to wash the blood from your hands
But it won't go
We're gonna keep you on the run
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue

 If I can't let you go will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out’s in your heart shaped box

But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you

As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I could still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
For it is there where you haunt me most (Haunt me most)
Where you haunt me most

I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hope that I sing through your memory
As we echo through time in the melody
Now I hate that I need you
And I hear you now when you said it hurt
But it had to fall, fall apart to work
As I see you now in what's left of me
Is it too late to plead insanity?
I won’t let go

'Cause I hate that it seemed you were never enough
You were broken and bleeding in the name of love
And I hope that we meet in another life
I hope that we meet in another life

 Get up, get up!
Fuck!
(Get out, never get out, never get out, never)
(Never let go, never let go, never go)

Spiraling inside my own disguise
"This is my design"
But we're not here together
Mirror mirror, tell me who you see
Am I you or me?
I can never remember
But you can't hide forever

I found myself by losing hope
I lost my way to find a home
I hid myself to stay alive
Now I'm ready to face my disguise

(Get out, never get out, never get out, never)
(Never let go, never let go, never go)

I am locked within the box I built from the inside out
Reassured by my doubt I
I don't want this fucking co-dependent vice
But desperate measures call for desperate lies (Desperate lies)
I found myself by losing hope
I lost my way to find a home
I hid myself to stay alive
Now I'm ready to face my disguise

Sick of wearing a mask
Sick of hiding my face
Sick of every motherfucker that is in my way
Sick of digging for answers
While you bury the truth
Fuck your method to my sadness, I will bury you
Dig

I will not become a figure of my mistakes
I will not become the mask, fear is not my fate
You can't turn down anger
You can't silence pain
You will not put out the fire that burns in me
That burns in me

I sold my soul to my disguise
I hid myself to stay alive
I found myself by losing hope
I lost my way to find a home
I hid myself to spite my eyes
I was losing myself in my disguise

Fear I follow
Safe in sorrow
(With) time l borrowed
I'm ready to face my disguise

 Blow the bridge to the past, wipe the fingerprints
Melt your heart encased in wax, steal it with a kiss
Our fate engraved, scar enslaved, as we mutually destruct
Repose, my love, I’ve sinned enough for the both of us
In the name of love...
I’m ready to bury all of my bones
I’m ready to lie but say I won’t
So tell me your secrets and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
Eternally yours
I feed like you taught me and selflessly swallow
We coalesce in darkness, so selfishly hollow
Examine the wreckage, writhing in tempo
Invisible anguish casting a shadow
And in the name of love...
I’m ready to bury all of my bones
I’m ready to lie but say I won’t
So tell me your secrets, and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
Eternally yours
As we rest in pieces, though I know not your name
I would suffer forever to absolve all your pain
And in the name of love
I’m ready to bury all of my bones
I’m ready to lie but say I won’t
So tell me your secrets, and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
I’m ready to bleed to make amends
And sleep in this dirt we call our bed
So tell me your secrets,  and join me in pieces
To fall and rewrite the bitter end
Eternally yours

I’m more than willing
To rot in hell with you11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Voices, in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They're pulling me under (Go)

I've swallowed myself but the fever remains
I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain
If I showed you my soul would you cover your eyes?
If I told you the truth would you dare me to lie?
I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind

Voices in my head again
Baiting me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices, Voices

As I walk through this valley of shadows and death
I curse not the “wicked”, I praise not the “blessed”
If I told you the truth, you’d beg me to change
If fear were a currency, you’d own the bank

Baiting me in a war I can't win

Trapped in a game inside my own skin

So calloused and frozen
Ugly and hopeless
I don't want to live forever
I just want to live right now

 Strip off the weight of morality, and check it at the door
I'll show you the worst in me

Blow out the candles, I need not a wish for I am everything
Now crawl to my boots and lick
Kneel before me
I'ma have my cake and fucking eat you too
It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to, die when I want to
The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown
I'll take the blame (and) parade it around
You’ve made me the villain you can’t live without
Reciting violence like poetry, no, you can't sit with us
Too fashionably plain
Now say my name
Forget everything you think you knew of who I used to be
I look much better as... as the enemy

Just to remind you of what you are not

Preaching to fill your pockets

Race the sunset, head for the bridge

Headless and hellbent for me

Live or die in the tale of the midnight ride
Where reality and superstition collide
Close your eyes, kiss your dearest Katrina goodbye
And beware of the tale, tale of the midnight ride

Revenge is cold and their heads will roll
(Headless, headless, headless)
Menace in the moonlight8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You're mine, motherfucker
Let me begin with envy’s a sin
You'll have to find new words to invent
'Cause I've heard your broken record
And I'm not impressed
I love when you talk, I just use it to drive me
I won't let your judgment define me
I'm not broken, so don't fix me
I want you to hate me
Tell me what you've lost
Hang me on your cross
If you're so wise, then why are you so soft?
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope
You're mine, motherfucker
I'm insane, I'm "insane in the membrane"
I wanna fuck your face with a switchblade
I'm not broken, so don't fix me
I'll leave you behind me
Internet killed the video star
Internet killed the video star
Tell me what you've lost, hang me on your cross
If you're so wise, then why are you so soft?
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope
Cry baby, cry baby
Did I just hear you whimper?
Cry baby, cry
Suck my middle fucking finger
Cry baby, cry baby
What have you done lately?
Cry baby, cry baby
What have you done?
Tell me what you've lost
Demonize my flaws
Do they call you when dumb needs a mascot?
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope
You dilate, God of your existence
Begging me to listen while you "pray"
Swallow in vain, silver spoon religion
Closer from a distance
You're mine, motherfucker5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 What the fuck?
Put your teeth to the curb, 'cause right now I'm gonna stomp your fucking face in
I hope you drown in all the cum you fucking swallow, to get yourself to the top
You're just a trend, just a fucking disease
How could you look at yourself in the mirror?
You stand for nothing and your heart is untrue
Every single thing about you's just a clone of the last "you"
All I want is to reach someone
To say something that could change their life forever
To let them know they're not alone
So many people wanna see me fail
So fucking clever but I'll spit in your face
I'll make sure you remember me

If all these words you speak of meant a thing
I'd take back all the lies against you that I sing
But I know that there's nothing real inside
Your heart's invested in feeding everyone lies

I've seen so many of you come and go
That's cause you're in it for all the wrong fucking reasons
You can't expect to live off of lies and survive
I am who I am, this is what we are
I don't care if this offends you, or your worthless god
To all the kids whose letters I receive
The broken-hearted, the damaged just like me
I will be your voice to let the world know we stand as one
We're standing right here so come and fucking get us

Open your mind before your mouth
Or come and fucking get us
Open your mind before your mouth
I'll be the end of your decadence

If all these words you speak of meant a thing
I'd take back all the lies against you that I sing

If all these words you speak of meant a thing
I'd take back all the lies against you that I sing
But I know that there's nothing real inside
Your heart's invested in feeding everyone lies

I may not have built this kingdom but
I'll make fucking sure that I protect it from you18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Some days I'm narcissistic, some days I'm in my way
Some days I try to sleep with pins and needles in my brain
Some days I feel sadistic, a portrait of my pain
Some days I live in fear that I am every fucking thing I hate

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Follow me down, under the skin, I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine

Some days I feel addictive, some days I feel alone
Some days I fear the worst in me is the best you'll ever know
Some days I feel the static with everyone I know
And some days I feel like I just want to slit a motherfucker's throat

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
You follow me down, under the skin, I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth through my eyes
I know that I’m gonna be fine
Swallow the pain, selling my sorrow for shame
Sanity circles the drain with a smile
I swear that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Oh God, am I gonna be fine?
Bright lights, am I dead or alive?
Someone say I'm not losing my mind
I made a deal with the devil inside
Oh God, I'm gonna be fine

(Go)
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up (Go)
Shut up, shut up, shut up (Go)
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up (Go)
Shut up, shut up, shut up

Feeding the flies in my mouth through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I swallow the pain, selling my sorrow for shame

 Well Mrs. Pharmacist, I insist
Fix me up with something quick
I’ve been a bad little boy and I think I’m getting sick
Sick to the bone
Slave to the flesh
Better put on my Sunday’s best
I’ve been a bad little boy... little boy

I’ve got a dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little secret
And I’m not, not, not, sure that I, I wanna keep it
So we feed ourselves lies to submit to the shadows
Cause we just wanna dance under our pretty perfect halos

Everyone’s got a secret
Whats yours? whats yours?
Don’t be shy, I’ll never repeat it

Oh, Mrs. Pharmacist
If I resist
Lock me up and bind my wrists
You’ve been a bad little girl...little girl
Close your eyes and listen close
I know just how much you love it
If you speak you lose your turn
So shut your mouth before I fuck it
I’ve got a dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little secret
And I’m not, not, not sure that I, I wanna keep it
So we feed ourselves lies to submit to the shadows
Cause we just wanna dance under our pretty perfect halos

Everyone’s got a secret
Tell me all about yours
Love, hate
Oh how we play the game
Cold soul
No sense of self control
Love, hate
Unsure to pass or play
Cold soul, now we’re out of control

Roses are red, and my heart is black
We creep about the floor to indulge like rats
Enraptured, we walk to nurse our obsession
Cause the roles that we play are paved with cruel intentions
Well Mrs. Pharmacist, if you insist

I’ve got a dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little secret
And I’m not sure that I wanna keep it
So we feed ourselves lies to submit to the shadows
And I just wanna shake you by your little perfect fucking halo
Everyone's got a secret
(What's yours? What's yours?)
And don't be shy, I'll never repeat it4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Spoken:
"Can we live without death?
Can we love without hate?
Can we want without need?
(I've fallen once again)
Do we really ever live our lives enough to appreciate that we can never truly grasp one without the other?
That a concept has no meaning without an opposing force?
If hate is what's inside us
Then hate is what defines us
(There's more inside of me)
And we will use our hate to drive us
(we are the damned)
And let death not deprive us
Do we want this or do we need this?
Do we want this or do we need this?
Do we want this or do we need this?!
You can always rinse the surface
But the stain will remain"
I fall
This is the end of you
This is the end of you
Whispers are their weakness
Their weakness
Everyday I must practice
To fake this smile on my face
It's all the rain that's putting me to sleep
It's all the rain that's putting me to sleep
I'll let the blood tell the truth tonight, this is my life's work
11 tracks is not enough, to tell you how I've died inside
And love is lost like words
11 tracks is not enough
In spiders eyes a man becomes a fly
In prolonged silence, we all stand defiled
We fall in line with the atrophy of life
The calm before the storm is a deafening silence
I've given my all, to this valley of despair
We are the damned, the cursed and the broken
There's so much more inside us
We are the lost, the sick and unspoken
There's so much more inside us
I'm drowning in an ocean of the tears that I've cried
I tried to drown my sorrows...
Instead they're all drowning me
I tried to drown my sorrows...
Instead they're all drowning me3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Seconds are left on the countdown
Panic attack, the next normal in bloom
I let you go to get a grip on myself
But will you welcome me back as someone else?

All my life I've been a time bomb (Now time is running out)
Juxtapose me with my past self (A doubt I can't surmount)
It's survival of the restless (Survival of the restless)
So split the difference between us

Looking back on the things that I've done
I should have known that I've always had more than enough
If tonight I fall asleep for the last timе
I want to be proud of the things that I've donе right

If I can learn how to hold my head up
Maybe life wouldn't seem like it's passin' me by
If I could give myself what I give to you
Then maybe I'd find strength to hold on to

Consumed by what I can't undo
Here we go again
Beyond the barricade, rip the curtain away
And you'll see the mess I've made
Beyond the barricade, rip the flesh away
And you'll see it's me you saved
If I could learn how to hold my head up
Maybe life wouldn't seem like it's passin' me by
If I could give myself what I give to you
Then maybe I'd find strength to hold on to
If I could learn how to hold my head up
Maybe life wouldn't seem like it's passin' me by
If I could give myself what I give to you
Then maybe I'd find faith to hold on to

Beyond the barricade, rip the flesh away
And you'll see the mess I've made
Beyond the barricade, wash the fear away
And you'll see it's me you saved
Beyond the barricade, we wash the fear away
And you'll see it's me you saved

If I could learn how to hold my head up
Maybe life wouldn't seem like it's passin' me by
If I could give myself what I give to you
Then maybe I'd find strength to hold on to
If I could learn how to hold my head up
Maybe life wouldn't seem like it's passin' me by
If I could give myself what I give to you
Then maybe I'd find faith to hold on

 I'm tired of feeling comatose
I've lost the me that I loved most
I'm barely holding on to smoke
I'm barely holding on to smoke

I'm not addicted but I'm not clean
Why do I do this to myself on repeat?
So disconnected from my own reality
Am I man or machine?
If I give, will you take?
As I lie for the taste
I just fuck it up
As you lap it up
(Go)
Through flesh and bone
I walk alone
(Go)
If I run, will I fade away?
'Cause I don't wanna leave it behind

In all my pride, all my shame
I find strength enough to show you
I may bend but I won't break
Because I define who I
Define who I become
I miss the me that I have not met
Choking in silence on the words left unsaid
I feel a sickness for a home I've never been
And I exist in black and white but now I'm seeing red
I built a shelter in complacency
Locked myself in and set fire and threw away the key
Too scared to live but I'm afraid to die
So am I living or am I just alive?

All my pride, all my shame
I find strength enough to show you
I may bend but I won't break
I define who I become
'Cause I'm tired of feeling comatose
I've lost the me that I loved most
I'm barely holding on to smoke
But I'm holding on, I'm holding on

Broken, I'm holding on
Driven to right the wrong
Silent, connected yet I feel so separated
Fallen through flesh and bone
Frozen, I stand alone
Deafened in silence, the voice remains
Behind my eyes, beneath my rage
I was struggling to get through
Out of time and out of faith
I define who I become

In all my pride, all my shame
I find strength enough to show you
I may bend but I won't break
'Cause I define who I
Define who I become
I'm tired of feeling comatose
I lost the me that I loved most
I'm barely holding on to smoke
But I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm tired of being human, tired of being numb
Waiting for the holy ghost to come
So save me from the webs that I have spun
I'm holding on, holding on
I'm holding on, holding on to smoke7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Go
Burn it down, brick by brick, made in 2006
Lost and found, losing grip, I needed this
Question me not, for I gave up everything
Forget me not 'cause I’ve not forgotten what this means
Strip me down, tear me apart, you’ll find one theme left
No sign of stopping 'til my veins rust
Strip me down, tear me apart, you’ll find one thing left
I fucking know where I came from
...And nothing can replace those lessons learned
As I stood with my brothers on the side of the road, woah
No longer haunted by the skeletons, woah
No longer haunted by the past
For so long, it’s all I’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow
For so long, no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring
(To make their deaf ears ring)
Miles repeat, my worst enemy... is me
But then four soon became six
To shatter the canvas
Handed nothing, loss pulling the strings
Outlived the dead trends, united by distance
For so long, it’s all I’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow
For so long, no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring
Miles repeat, my worst enemy... is me
But then four soon became six... to shatter the canvas
Handed nothing, loss pulling the strings
Outlived the dead trends, united by distance
I’ve been to hell and back, with no promise of return
So I made friends with fire, to keep from getting burned
No money, no sleep. dedication
10 years on the road this is sacred
And when I’m facing a wall, I do not quit
...'Cause if you mean it, you will make it
Pulled apart in a world so demanding
I’m still here, still standing
I’ve sweat blood from Stockholm to Scranton
Still here, still standing
You can always rinse the surface, but the stain will remain
For so long, it’s all I’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
I did my time
You live, you learn, you defy the terms, but this house will be my home
Beguiled, betrayed, it’s the price we pay, as trust will be our tomb
If you mean it, you'll make it..9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Catharsis in darkness
When you can't seem to feel a thing
The absence that haunts you
Won't hurt much longer

Catharsis in darkness
When you can't seem to feel a thing
The absence that haunts you
Won't hurt much longer

This feeling's getting a bit harder to control
A place to feel completed or a place to be alone?
The rhythm of rebellion from the rattle in your bones
A sonic liberation, salvation in your headphones

Darkest disguise
Leave it at the door
Bright lights divine
(Leave your body on the floor)

Catharsis in darkness
When you can't seem to feel a thing
The absence that haunts you
Won't hurt much longer
Stand in the shadows, entertaining the unknown
The words I always needed like I wrote them on my own
I sing for absolution, for the cleansing of my soul
Narcotic is the beating of our hearts to the tempo

Holding through time
Leave it at the door
Bright lights divine
(Leave your body on the floor)

Catharsis in darkness
When you can't seem to feel a thing
The absence that haunts you
Won't hurt much longer

Catharsis in darkness
When you can't seem to feel a thing
The darkness that haunts you

Catharsis in darkness
A place to feel the words we sing
The absence that haunts you

 Isn't that what everyone wants to know
Pretty new girl walks into a room, everyone's head turns
Looks her up and down wondering who's she fucking
Who could she fuck?
And how high could she climb?
And is it higher than me?
Tragedy, a poisonous lover
You infiltrate to destroy
Vanity, a cancer unforgiving
A charlatan with poise
Fool me once, enough is enough
Was I more than a step on your way up?
Hollowed out, I've no semblance of love
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Lest we learn, the tables turn
So I'm betting out, I'm betting out
You can be the prey in your masquerade
But I'm getting out, I'm getting out
There's nothing left to repair
Ravenous, self-righteous, and lurid
But how much more till you break?
Scavenger, so fucking undeserving
You slither in just to take what you can take
Counterfeit, I'm calling your bluff
Was I more than just a step on your way up?
Now you'll burn and you're flesh out of luck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Lest we learn, the tables turn
So I'm betting out, I'm betting out
You can be the prey in your masquerade
But I'm getting out, I'm getting out
Against insight I fed your source of revenue
But now, it means nothing to me to mean anything to you
Open grave, I was too blind to see
That "love", spelled to you is
"F-A-M-E"
You fuck your way up the ladder
Going down on your way to the top
Do your arms ever tire?
Or do they heal while you climb with your mouth?
Delete everything, sever the yearning
You can keep the fucking ring
Delete everything
You can keep the fucking ring
Nothing left to repair1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Plastic royalty exposed
You wanna play the victim, to preach upon your throne
No semblance of virtue as your relevance erodes
We go queen for queen  and move just like this

Just a pawn in a kings disguise
I never said I’m perfect, there’s a guilt behind these eyes
So check me If it helps you fall asleep at night

Are you the prey or spider in the web of all your lies?
When you fall down
Will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown?

You don’t know humble… though you play the role
Pockets of evergreen are your amphetamine

Be careful, or you’ll run your mouth off your face

You gotta be crass, you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up, turn it up now
Another day, a double shot of hate
Drink it up like gasoline
Underpaid, you graduate, to build somebody else's dream
With a noose as a tie
Do you fantasize of a much different life?
The fix for who they want you to be, directly streamed to your TV

You gotta be loud, you gotta be rude, so the world can hear you
You gotta be crass, you gotta be cold, it's everything we know

A broken home you're trying to mend
You've got one day left to pay the rent
We're not sure, but we believe in the lie
That it'll all be fine when we die

 I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me

But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together

And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved
Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people
Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too?
Did its people want too much?

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright
And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me
And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody

 I love everybody because I love you
When you stood up, walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
I looked over it and I ached

I love everybody because I love you
I don't need the city, and I don't need proof
All I need, darling is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft, and I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond

Reach out the car window trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her, I give you a grin
Oh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape
So I follow the white lines, follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road as I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

 I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 AM

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things, too
But I'm working for the knife

I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys

I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife

I used to think I'd be done by twenty
Now at twenty-nine, the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at thirty, I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife

I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right, but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly when they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts, like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night, carefully
I was going to live

You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine, you were looking in yours
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night, quietly
It was told to believe

I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

Nobody told me it ended

Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch

Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?

It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too

Mom, would you wash my back?
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue

With every drop of rain singing

"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but

Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me

And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today, I will wear my white button-down

Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleep

It's funny how they're all the same

And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is and it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back

It would be a hundred times easier

He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him, and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, "Again, I have to clean"
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair

So I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be

There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart

 You gotta keep 'em separated

Like the latest fashion
Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...

Hey! Man, you talkin' back to me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey! Man, you disrespectin' me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey, they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18, you won't be doing any time
Hey! Come out and play

By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...
Hey! Man, you disrespectin' me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey! Man, you talkin' back to me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey, they don't pay no mind

 My friend's got a girlfriend, man he hates that bitch
He tells me every day
He says, "Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kinda way."

She sits on her ass, he works his hands to the bone
To give her money every payday
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"

I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
To keep her bill collectors at bay
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
’Cause that girl's got expensive taste

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Well, I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all, woh yeah
But hey man, free rides just don't come along every day
(Let me tell you about my other friend now)

My friend's got a boyfriend, man she hates that dick
She tells me every day
He wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"

"I won't give you no money, I always pay
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way

I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal, it's so unfair

And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
Black roses and "Hail Mary's"
Can't bring back what's taken from me

I reach to the sky and call out your name
And if I could trade, I would

And it feels, and it feels like

 Hey, man, you know I'm really okay
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
’Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off, it makes me insane
I open the glove box, reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

 If you could only read my mind
You would know that things between us ain't right
I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie

Your one vice
Is you're too nice
Come around now, can't you see?

I want you, all tattooed
I want you bad
Complete me, mistreat me
I want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

If you could only read my mind
You would know that I've been waiting so long
For someone almost just like you
But with attitude, I'm waiting, so come on

Get out of clothes time
Grow out those highlights
Come around now, can't you see?
I want you, in a vinyl suit
I want you bad
Complicated, x-rated
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad

Don't get me wrong
I know you're only being good

 Well, I'd like to tell you all about my dream, it's a place
Where strip malls abound and diversion's mere moments away
Where culture's defined by the ones least refined
And you'll be left behind if you don't fit in
It's all distorted in Americana my way
Well, fuck you!

Well, my dream has come true
My vision has come true

Now give me my cable, fast food, four-by's, tat's right away
I want it right now ’cause my ge-generation don't like to wait
My future's determined by thieves, thugs, and vermin
It's quite an excursion but it's okay
Everything's backwards in Americana my way
Well, fuck you!

Well, my dream has come true
My vision has come true
Yeah, it's all coming true
I'm a product
Of my environment
So don't blame me, I just work here
But I wanna fuck it up

My rights are denied by those least qualified
Trading profit for pride, but it's okay
Everything's backwards in Americana my way
Well, fuck you!

Leave me alone, asking a lot

 Getting edgy all the time
Someone around me just a step behind
It's kind of scary, the shape I'm in
Walls are shaking and they're closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
Paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you, something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends ’cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
Being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground
Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll

Way back, when we were just kids
’Cause your eyes told the tale of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did

Oh, waves of time
Seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes
For you, this never ends

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Though the marks on your dress had been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I should've spoke out, and I'm so sorry now
I didn't know, ’cause we were so young

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on innocence left behind
It never goes away
Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying

 Goodbye, my friend, you've messed up again
You're going to prison, you're off to the pen
You've gotten off easy so many times
I guess no one told you how to get a life
The judge wasn't lenient like he was before
You got three to five and a kick out the door
The public defender really did try
Too little, too late, you didn't get a life

Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time!
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Folsom Prison is the destination
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time!
In the scheme of life, we're all just brothers
Rehabilitate with all the others
Well, I'll see ya!

That car looked so tempting, so easy to drive
Just like that apartment that you burglarized
You started to run, but didn't get far
’Cause under your arm was a VCR
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time!
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Folsom Prison is the destination
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time!
In the scheme of life, we're all just brothers
Rehabilitate with all the others
Well, I'll see ya!

I'm innocent
I didn't do it
I didn't do nothin', man
This is bullshit
He gave it to me... it was, it was a present
Ho ho, not this time, my friend
You'll be in lockdown by ten
I'm afraid you can't talk your way out of this one, son
Now four walls are your 24-hour-a-day, constant companions

Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time!
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Folsom Prison is the destination
Hey, in Walla, I'll see you in Walla Walla
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time!
In the scheme of life, we're all just brothers
Rehabilitate with all the others

Well, I'll see ya
Have a nice life!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Falling, I'm falling
Falling, I'm falling

Have you ever walked through a room
But it was more like the room passed around you
Like there was a leash around your neck that pulled you through
Have you ever been at some place
Recognizing everybody's face
Until you realized that there was no one there you knew

(Well, I know) Some days, my soul's confined and out of mind
Sleep forever
(I know) Some days, I'm so outshined and out of time
Have you ever


Have you ever buried your face in your hands
’Cause no one around you understands
Or has the slightest idea what it is that makes you be
Have you ever felt like there was more
Like someone else was keeping score
And what could make you whole was simply out of reach
(Well, I know) Someday, I'll try again and not pretend
This time forever
(I know) Someday, I'll get it straight, but not today
Have you ever


(Falling, I'm falling) Some days, my soul's confined and out of mind
Sleep forever
(Falling, I'm falling) Some days, my darkest friend is me again
Have you ever

This time forever
Someday, I'll get it straight, but not today

When the truth walks away
Everybody's dazed
’Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay
So if you walk away
Who is gonna stay
’Cause I'd like to think the world is a better place

So if you walk away

 Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I won't let them

If I seem bleak, well, you'd be correct
And if I don't speak, it's 'cause I can't disconnect
But I won't be burned by the reflection of the fire in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun

Whoa
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun

When I ran, I didn't feel like a runaway
When I escaped, I didn't feel like I got away
There's more to living than only surviving
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying

Though you hear me, I don't think that you relate
My will is something that you can't confiscate
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated by destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
Whoa
As you're staring at the sun

When I ran, I didn't feel like a runaway
When I escaped, I didn't feel like I got away

 We never have sex anymore
We never roll around on the floor like we did so long ago
And you never yell at me anymore
You never want to even the score like you did so long ago
But you're still with me, so I guess I'm not complaining
And you always leave my dinner on the stove

Baby, please
If you won't love me, will you hate me?
If you won't violate me
Will you at least just aggravate me?
Baby, please (We never have sex anymore)
It feels like war under the covers, one way or the other is what I say
Hey, hey, hey

We never have sex anymore
We never make love 'til we're sore like we did so long ago

You never even threaten my life like you did so long ago

And you let me drive your car when you're not home

 Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it, we are one
(One, two, three, four)

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide

I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
Pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time, we can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow?
Our time is up

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey

If you saw what goes inside our own
I bet you'd lead the way

 Remember when Hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give
All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But Heaven was in my head

They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild, now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost, I can live
Souls don't break, they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through
Yeah, death is an open door
Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry
What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday
Yeah

They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way

 Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I wasn't ready for the rapture, we're only passing through
But these words, they mean nothing to me
I know that time will mend this fracture, I've been lost in a maze
And every route I take, leads right back to you

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm
When will I finally get the message?
Some things are broken beyond repair
This is my cross to bear
My own meaningless catastrophe
I never had the time to prepare
Because I never knew that all my nightmares could come true
Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones
Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've spent my fair share
In the deepest depths of despair
'Cause I was too lost down there to care
I wasn't braced for the fallout
I wasn't braced for the fallout
I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm
When will I finally get the message?

 As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, let me live and die in peace

I will be consumed, returned into the earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace
"Change, and everything is change, nothing can be held on to
To the degree that you go with a stream
You see, you are still
You are flowing with it
But to the degree you resist the stream, then you notice
That the current is rushing past you and fighting you
So swim with it, go with it
And you're there, you're at rest"

It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own

When my heart skips two beats...
I am hidden deep, fast asleep
...The sea will part where oceans meet
Finally complete

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law
Swan song, a declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace

 The weight of the world is resting on thin ice
When the surface breaks, will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect
What a waste of time I was in retrospect
I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

Do you remember when you said to me: "My friend, hope is a prison"?
Hope is a prison
Of all the patterns that I could create
I built a labyrinth with no escape
To keep myself under lock and key
I am my own worst enemy
I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve
I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me
If I could silence all the doubt in me
Accept that what is meant to be (is meant to be)
You ever wonder how deep you could sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

There's not enough water in the world
To wash the blood from our hands
We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul
It grows without light and feeds from our bones
Hell must be empty, all the devils are here
Singing us the Lord's Prayer; finally, something that we all share

I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head
Don't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves
And the serpents will bite as they please

 Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
Sunk this low
Rotten to the core!

So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we're gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror
You knew all along, that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son, but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan
A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution
A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution
The price of your collusion

You knew all along that the cancer would spread
So don’t be surprised to find a price on your head
Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low!
Sunk this low!
You are rotten to the core!
You are rotten to the core!
You are rotten to the core!
You are rotten to the core!7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 All is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost
All is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost

Waiting for a sign washed up on the shoreline
I'll always carry the cross, but all is not lost
I just can't relate a crack in the floodgate
Life comes at a cost, but all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever

Taking back what's mine, but it's lost to the skyline
A bridge I cannot cross, but all is not lost
Now there's no escape; God, what a sorry state
Love comes at a cost, but all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Can you feel the empty space?
Can you feel the fire at the gates?
Can you live a life worth dying for?

 Do you cross your heart when you hope to die?
Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane?
IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel, we're crawling on all fours
Will you fall on that sword at the second coming?
You're gonna taste the ash and dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

Now the wheels are turning
What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?

You wanna make your Hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, whoa-oh)
Sure sounds like Heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, whoa-oh)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Give us a Judas steer we can deify
Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades
So wash us away, garroted by a halo, take a bow 'cause time's running out
There's no doubt that the end is coming
You're gonna taste the ash, you're gonna taste the dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms
Now the wheels are turning

Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Post-love, post-truth
Justice lays bound and black-bagged, ready for the guillotine
We can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the gods clipped the wings off the phoenix?"
They clipped the wings off the phoenix, oh
When will we wrestle the world from the fools and their gold and the fucking covenant? (We'll be waiting)
Will enough be enough when we're holding on for dear life?

Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some
Bitter and then some

They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow
But we're still holding on for dear life
You sold us all down the river
I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver
You said you'd change the world, but death still flies east
The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen this all before

We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank, oh

They say the more things change, the more they stay the same
While the liars leech, the crooked preach
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it
It beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?
You fucking parasite, blegh
There's no room in here for an honest man
Only callous and cold hearts

 This is a wake-up call
No rise without the fall
Facing the great divide
You can run but you can't hide
You can run but you can't hide

I met the devil and God
And couldn't tell them apart
I thought I found the end
But it was only the start

I've heard it all before
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
Just let go, gravity, hold on to me
So come and wash us away
Just thank fuck we don't last forever
It's now or never
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere
'Cause it's gone and it's never coming back

So make no mistake
It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks
So stand your ground, the earth will shake
So twist the knife 'cause I am finally awake
So come and wash us away
Just thank fuck we don't last forever

Do you really think Christ was a capitalist?
Every man for himself
Let thy neighbour drown, amen

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

Now discourse is dead
Stood at the tip of the wing
You've gotta watch where you tread

Round up the ambivalent, you mustn't sit in the shade
'Cause it's blasphemous for one to abstain from hate
We're all sisters and brothers
But if you're one of the others, then fuck you

Chewing through our tonguеs

'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
No common sense left in these empty heads, swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts, two poles apart, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

 I guess we're mortal after all

One day all of us will give up the ghost
Too lost in the light to see what matters most
All ends will be met
And all worlds must collapse

Another part of the symphony lost between eternity
But God is in the detail
I know that there's a part of me, doomed to face infinity
'Cause every wave has gotta break
Has gotta break

The truth is, all of us are hostages
Staring down the throat of the screaming abyss
Surrendering is half the battle
But we're powerless to resist

Looking down on us, all the children that you despise
God only knows why we were born to burn

A bullet in the neck doesn't feel much like love
A message of rejection sent from above
No flags, no holy books
I'll be in hell with the misunderstood

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget
A desperate picture of God's regret
Are we perfect mistakes? Or almighty fuck ups?
One thing's for sure, he doesn't fucking love us

Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across

Our collapse will be remission
The planet scarred beyond all recognition
Suicide in slow motion

Too cowardly to face this
We've got a fucking deathwish
You wanna play with fire?
Don't cry when you get burnt
You gave us life
We gave back death in return

 From the cradle to the grave
Destined to break like the waves
Existence is so threatening
It takes a fierce grace to crack us open
A moment sat with our sentencing
And the light comes flooding in, oh, the light comes flooding in
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating, "There's nothing left"
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

With the ravens here to stay
And the doves all flying away
Sedation feels so welcoming
In the subtle space, there's an endless ocean
But the devils sing and it's deafening
What a world we're living in, oh, we're never listening
When the leaves fall in the spring
May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating, "There's nothing left"
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

I've got a lot to lose, but I won't lie to you
And make-believe sincerity, I'm praying for a remedy
Beloved distant blue, one day, I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity 'cause death is not my enemy

I wanna be there to witness the downfall

They'll only sell us out when our backs are turned
But we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Every snake has its price
If the money's on the table, they don't think twice
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin

We are paralysed
But there are none so blind as those who will not see
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck
About what matters to us

Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Always out for blood, preying on the weak
We can count on them to paint the future bleak
But we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry
We are paralysed
But there are none so blind as those who will not see

Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe

Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price
Lifetime slave
Living in a suburban grave
If there was a God, was a God
You would be the death of him

These colours don't run
Like colours from the face
Eyes roll back, chemical despair
It's true what they say, life isn't fair

So repeat this line: "Everything, everything is fine"

'Cause there's no escape once the fuse is lit, locked in this pantheon
Swimming with concrete shoes, the reaper comes to take the best of you
Can you see the writing on the wall?

There is a subtle space that we’ll all discover
'Cause there is a seat reserved for thе spirit, passing through one by one
Riding a torpedo, wе wash away into the overflow
Can you see the writing on the wall?

We're barricaded 'cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sown, then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated, we're all players in a symphony that fights against impermanence
Again and again and again and again and again

Again and again and again
Do you really wanna live forever? Oh

We are so lost staring into all the colour
It hurts, but reality is counterfeit, we came from the beyond
Living a cameo, one final breath and then we split in two
Can you see the writing on the wall?

Eviscerated, we're all players in a symphony that fights against impermanence

Do you really wanna live forever?

The cliff edge in front of me, no cloud can catch me now

It brings me closer to God
But keeps the dirt in the wound, and now the beast has teeth
I’ve got my hand on my heart
I thought that I knew the way, but I've been torn apart

'Cause we forget that the sun sets
And we're not long for this world
No cloud can catch me now

The Devil's recruits whisper in my ear
"Go tighten that noose", but it's clear

The burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

I'm fettered and abused
Stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one-man submarine?
I only want the truth
So tonight, we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive
Without love, I won't survive

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

Love hurts, oh oh, love hurts
Without love I won’t survive
Love hurts, oh, love hurts
Without love I won’t survive9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You are stellar

Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night
Watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place
Won't you come with me?
We could start again

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close
If you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place
It might be the only way
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you

How do you do it?

Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby

Artist:Incubus, 
 To see you when I wake up
Is a gift I didn't think could be real
To know that you feel the same as I do
Is a three-fold utopian dream

You do something to me that I can't explain
So would I be out of line if I said I miss you?

I see your picture, I smell your skin on
The empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days
But already I'm wasting away

I know I'll see you again, whether far or soon
But I need you to know that I care and I miss you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Better than watching Geller bending silver spoons
Better than witnessing new born nebulas in bloom
She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings

I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
To know you

Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go
And higher than the heights of what we often think we know
Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees
To obtain a 'bird's eye' is to turn a blizzard into a breeze
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

 I'd like to close my eyes, go numb
But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high-rise today
It's not a breeze cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know
Watch the warmth blow away

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

So do you think I should adhere to that pressing new frontier?
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?
Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow... you grow old
So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

Kudos to those who see through sickness-yea

Over and over and over and over and...

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by

I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn? When will we change?
Just in time to see it all fall down
Those left standing, will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning - warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
Floating in this cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like frogs oblivious to the water starting to boil
No one flinches, we all float face down

If I hadn't assembled myself

Powers that be would have swallowed me up
But that's more than I can allow
Bow, ah yeah
If you let them make you
They'll make you papier-mâché
At a distance you're strong
Until the wind comes
Then you crumble and blow away
If you let them fuck you
There will be no foreplay
But rest-assured
They'll screw you complete
Until your ass is blue and gray

You should make amends with you
If only for better health, better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?

Oars freed from their holes long ago
Lying face up on the floor of my vessel
I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow

Further down the river

Two weeks without my lover
I'm in this boat alone
Floating down a river named emotion
Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown

Further down the river
Further down the river

Further down the river

I'm building an antenna
Transmissions will be sent when I am through
Maybe we could meet again further down the river
And share what we both discovered then revel in the view

And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away
Could I push rewind?
The credits traverse signifying the end
But I missed the best part, could we please go back to start?

Forgive my indecision

Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again
Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, babe

Eleven a.m
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bed sheets shade the heat of choices I've made
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in that old fear

Forgive my indecision
I am only a man

Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again, again, again

Heavy head up from my pillow, who could it be?

 At first I see an open wound
Infected and disastrous
It breathes chaotic catastrophe
It cries to be renewed (Please renew me!)
Its tears are the color of anger
They dry to form a scab
To the touch, its stiff and resilient
Underneath, the new skin breathes, yeah


It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?

As outwardly cliche as it may seem
Yes, something under the surface says "c'est la vie"
There is a circle, it is a plan
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Look closely at the open wound
See past what covers the surface
Underneath chaotic catastrophe
Creation takes the stage, so
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again

It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?

Until the twentieth century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see, and hear. Since the initial publication of the chart of electromagnetic spectrum, humans have learned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear is less than one millionth of reality.

Fallacious cognitions
Spewed from televisions
Do mold our decisions
So stop and take a look and you'll see what I see now
Now!

Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free

And it's hard to say where it went so wrong
And failed me in the end

Let me take you back to when I was killed and born again
Woke up in the light convinced my life had made it to its end
Burning up beneath the sun while my father drained of blood
If he's there, I've got a message for the man that's up above
Fuck you

If he's home, I've got a message from below
Getting out is not enough if nobody else can come
If he's home, I've got a message for the man above

Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place

Did you think you could dig deep enough to bury me?
It's over when I say and you're not getting rid of me
So walk into my fire or step into my light
Either way it's gonna burn if you don't make this right, oh
Shit
If he's home, I've got a message from below

Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place

Dead meat

Getting out is not enough if nobody else can come
If he's home, I've got a message for the man above

Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face

 Only in madness do you find beautiful death
And only in sadness do you feel happy instead

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you don't know
The guilt I carried this far all on my own
It's nothing you wanna feel

Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till it's not enough
Don't wait for the world to let go of the both of us
Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till you've had enough
Don't wait for the world to let go or to give you up

The silence is one thing that I'll remember you said
Well, it's better than nothing when nothing's all that you left

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you don't know
The guilt I carried this far wasn't my own
It's nothing you wanna feel, so let it go

Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till it's not enough
Don't wait for the world to let go of the both of us
Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till you've had enough
Don't wait for the world to let go or to give you up
If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot
You'd be a better memory alive rather than not
If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot
You'd be a better memory if no one else forgot
So let it go

Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till it's not enough
Don't wait for the world to let go of the both of us
Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till you've had enough
Don't wait for the world to let go or to give you up

(If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot)
I'm not giving up
(You'd be a better memory alive rather than not)
So don't you give up
(If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot)
I'm not giving up
(You'd be a better memory if no one else forgot)
So don't you give up4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 The sutures in my head keep getting ripped out
These open wounds are the thoughts I can't stop thinking about
Digging for purpose, feelings resurface
And involuntarily my system gets nervous
Tell me tonight that you'll be by yourself
'Cause something bad will happen if you are with someone else
I'm just all fucked up, and I really need your help
I really need your help
There's a lot of hollow souls out there all alone
And they're waiting for you to invite them back into my home
They touched and they took what was rightfully mine
Now I'm the devil, and their souls just went up in price

Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now

I pour myself to sleep into a glass that you keep
And that's all I'll ever be if you don't set me free
I know it's hard, but I'll be damned if I live in your hands
So, please, put me down so I don't feel a thing
My pretty little face with all the right parts
My pretty little face I couldn't keep from the dark
I learned from the best as my sorrows grew
And then they pulled me out after I introduced 'em to you
We're just two wrong souls that met at the wrong time
So just go your way, and I'll go mine
You'll be alone with someone new until the day that you die
And I'll watch from afar to make sure you're alright
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now

 Dead on the inside

Raised by wolves in sheep's clothes that abandoned me
But taught me to get up when I fall to my knees
Man makes monster, monster kills man
Taking your crown's always been part of the plan
If you weren't so stuck in your own head
You'd be where I am now instead

Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help, when you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
'Cause the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out
Drown you out

I've learned a lot, but it took me too long
To find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside?
Dead on the inside
Dead on the inside
If you want an enemy, I'll be the last one that you ever meet
But I can tell you now that you don't stand a goddamn chance against me

Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help, when you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
'Cause the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out

I've learned a lot but it took me too long
To find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside?

Fuck that, fuck this; if you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim
Fuck that, fuck this; if you're gonna burn a bridge

 What will I have left when even the hurt is gone
And I can't feel a thing?
Would you had been there when I came home?
Could you hold on another day?
I wish I had not held, held on to you so long
But I was just so damn afraid
I wish I hadn't used you to pull me
Out of this dark and lonely place

I had the whole damn world and I gave it all away
What did I think I would save?
For better or for worse, this is my burden to take
'Cause I'm the only one to blame
You're so much better off
With nothing but memories of, memories of my face
Because I have no use now that you're gone
And now I'm running out of faith

Together we will live forever

I'm not afraid anymore, forever
I'm not afraid anymore, we will live forever
I'm not afraid anymore, forever

 If you were cast out, what's your next move gonna be?
Will you return cold, or will you turn up the heat?
God, please, forgive those who doubt me

Did you really think the pain
Would send me to an early grave?
Did you think I couldn't break these chains
After all the hell I overcame?

God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames

Well, I am back now and stronger than you think
'Cause when it's dark, the light gets easier to see
They say I sold out and bid my dignity
But the truth is, the Devil sold his soul to me

To me, to me
The Devil sold his soul to me
To me, to me
The Devil sold his soul to me
God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames
God, please, forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Make sure they never forget my name

The greatest trick that the Devil did
Was convince the world he doesn't exist

 You set me up as the villain
But you never mentioned the root of the problem
Took what you wanted and flipped it
But you won't be dragging my name to the bottom

So much unsaid, left me for dead
I won't forget, and now you're next
Well, everyone's listening, and they know the difference
You're not failing our senses

If you're throwing me to the lions
You should know I'm not scared of dying
I wouldn't take back one thing I did, one word I said
But I'm gonna make you wish you did

Jump to conclusions, they fall for illusions
But you wouldn't dare try to stop them
You're going low at the end of the road
But that won't be the path that I follow

So much unsaid, left me for dead
I won't forget, you're on my list
Well, everyone's listening, and they know the difference
You're not failing our senses
If you're throwing me to the lions
You should know I'm not scared of dying
I wouldn't take back one thing I did, one word I said
But I'm gonna make you wish you did

I'm holding on to this until the scale's untilted

Well, everyone's listening
And they know the difference
You're not failing our senses
But you're pushing my limits

You should know I'm not scared of dying
I wouldn't take back one thing I did, one word I said, whoa

Choking on every word you said, we'll see, we'll see
Don't breathe another word about me
I'll leave, and you can finally rest in peace, we'll see

When I go out into the world
I just don't like what I see
You could call it Paradise
But it looks just like Hell to me

Lying in between the memories choking me, and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
Lying in between the memories choking me, and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know

Speaking in languages we can't read
No need for you to spell it out for me, for me
Swallowed up and I spit you out
Like a drug that just wouldn't stay down, stay down

When I go out into the world
I just don't like what I see

 Gave it all to burn forever underneath the rain
Drowning in the present of a past that I couldn't change
Writing songs instead of letters because I'm too afraid
Afraid of coming back to find that everything is the same
Everything is the same

I made my way through hell again, I paid for my mistakes
Next time I think I'll stay awhile and pour myself a drink
When I return, I'll look for you, so listen for your name
If you can make it out above the roaring of the flames

If it's the mask you want, then it's the mask that you will get
But when I take it off, remember that you asked for this
I tore myself apart to give you all that I could give
Don't think that I will let it go, don't think that I'll forget
I thought I wanted legacy, I thought I wanted fame
I didn't know I'd lose all my loved ones in exchange
Left 'em all behind, and, yeah, for that I am ashamed
But that's the price I'm paying till I'm buried in my grave

Gave it all to burn forever underneath the rain
Drowning in the present of a past that I couldn't change
Writing songs instead of letters because I'm too afraid
Afraid of coming back to find that everything is the same

And this time you're not leaving me in the dark
You took me for granted, now look where you are
Atop of a kingdom you built out of cards

Thought I could change, thought I could make it out
Promises break, need to hear you say
"You're gonna keep it now"

I miss the way you say my name
The way you bend, the way you break
Your makeup running down your face
The way you touch, the way you taste

When the curtains call the time will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize love's the death of peace of mind

You're in the walls that I made
With crosses and frames hanging upside down
For granted, in vain, I took everything
I ever cared about

I miss the way you say my name

Your makeup running down your face
The way you fuck, the way you taste

Leaving me in your wake
You come and go in waves

I'd like to think that it's my ugly human nature instead
Because I don't feel remorse for the things that I did
But I pray I have the chance to do them all again

 Blinded by a fear of feeling, these are the kings we chose
Lost and looking for the meaning, I've been searching high and low
When we fade into nothing, when we go up in the smoke
We’ll beg God for a mercy that He knows we'd never show

On a canvas we stained with blood and painted with our sins
There's a candle melting and it’s burning at both ends
We'll take and take till it caves and drowns us in the wax it drips
Like a moth to the flame, you never should've fucking lit

You can give sight to the blind
But you can't force them to see
You could take us back in time
But it wouldn't change a thing

If God came down from His kingdom, He came down from His home
And we asked Him if He'd take us back, He would surely tell us no
If God came down from His kingdom, He came down from his throne
And we asked Him if He'd take us back, He would tell us we can't go

To a rat in a maze, the end is where the start begins
But if we made it out, I know that we would do it all again
We live and die in vain like treasure on a sinking ship
All in the name of a God we’d just abandon and forget
If God came down from His kingdom, He came down from His home
And we asked Him if He’d take us back, He would surely tell us no
If God came down from His kingdom, He came down from his throne
And we asked Him if He'd take us back, He would tell us we can’t go

We're dying every day
Tell me, is it all in vain?
Is it worth the suffering?
Is it worth the price we paid?
Is it worth it?
Yeah

You can give sight to the blind

They tried to keep in the secrets that you wouldn't tell

You'll have a friend down in Hell after all
And if you're there to catch me when I fall
Then maybe Hell ain't so bad after all

I didn't want to believe how much you needed help
And I just left you to be all by yourself
And now I wish I had seen that you weren't doing well
But I just came back to see how hard you fell

Well, if I'm there to catch you when you fall
You'll have a friend down in Hell after all
And if you're there to catch me when I fall
Then maybe Hell ain't so bad after all

Build me up or tear me down, I will never make a sound
Build me up or tear me down
Run a dagger through my chest, I believe it's for the best
Build me up or tear me down
There are scars that'll never ever show themselves
You get when you're left alone too long in Hell
They tried to keep in the secrets that you wouldn't tell
But they just stripped you for parts you had to sell

And if you're there to catch me when I fall
Then maybe Hell ain't so bad after all

Build me up or tear me down, I will never make a sound
Build me up or tear me down
Run a dagger through my chest, I believe it's for the best
Build me up or tear me down

Well, if I'm there to catch you when you fall
You'll have a friend down in Hell after all
And if you're there to catch me when I fall

 Old friend, don't you see me
With my soul on my sleeve and my heart left to beat underground?
Don't you leave me
With the hope and belief that you're coming for me

Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?
Well, when I've given up and all is said and done
Will you just look the other way?
Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?
Well, when I've given up and all is said and done
Will you just look the other way?

Half dead, barely breathing
Fell apart just to keep my head up in one piece till I'm found
Well, I'm sinking
To the floor of the sea where you want me to be

Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?
Well, when I've given up and all is said and done
Will you just look the other way?
Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?

I waited for nothing at all

 That crooked smile doesn't hide your greed, all of your hypocrisies
I'm gonna tell everyone the truth
Live in denial while your insides bleed, and I will keep you company
So I can watch when your world's consumed

I was there when it began, and I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in
Once I've sunk my teeth in

I won't take part in your complacency or words you don't really mean
All that you did was light my fuse
Soon you'll be nothing but a memory, and I won't keep you company
When everything falls apart for you

I was there when it began, and I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in
I was there when it began, and I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in

I'll take my time with you
I'll take my time with you once I've sunk my teeth in
I was there when it began, and I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in

 Lost again and feeling broken, you can see the change
I thought I had it all, but you can see the change

Falling, fading away
I'm crawling to sleep to dreams I couldn't keep
Breaking, slipping away
Where you are so near, and we're back at the start
If this dream should last forever, I pray to die

Between the city's gates and nowhere is where I'll be, my dear
Ghost of soldiers will greet you and point the way to me, my dear

Falling, fading away
I'm crawling to sleep to dreams I couldn't keep
Breaking, slipping away
Where you are so near, and we're back at the start

 What's left to say that hasn't been already said before?
Did I ever have a purpose? I can't feel it anymore
If ignorance is happiness, please, steal me from my head
'Cause the voices once so soothing make me feel so fucking, so fucking dead

I'd give anything for something to feel anything at all
It just seems so goddamn meaningless, it all seems so devolved
We're drowning in irrelevance, we're hiding from the truth
We are the numb complacent, we are the broken youth

What's left to say that hasn't been?

We come undone, we are the ugly truth

Medicated, sedated in the back seat of our lives
It's so fucking hard to swallow, will we make it out alive?

 There's no rest for the wicked
There's not a home underneath the mud
And we're all dead, so what's the difference
Between a god and a loaded gun?

I am the sun, rain, the ocean
I am the flood, flames, the chosen

It's in our blood, it's on our breath
It's in the taste between life and death
It's in our blood

I hung myself up on a cross to bleed
Nobody cared, nobody listened to me
So I'm not carrying the weight of a conscience
Bring the floods, bring the flames, bring the violence

It's in our blood, it's on our breath
It's in the taste between life and death
It's in our hearts, it's in our heads
It's for the lives we never got to live
It's in our blood
There's no rest for the wicked
There's not a home underneath the mud

There's no rest for the wicked
There's not a home underneath the mud

 The distance to heaven is measured in gold
So if you stop along the way
Make sure that you save it when you sell your soul
So you can afford to stay
All we want is something to keep us
From the things we're afraid to know
But what we need is something to free us
From the fear that we can't let go

Running in circles and I can't think straight
Running in circles and I can't escape

Well, we're gonna live forever, and I've never felt so sure
Everything has always been what we're looking for
Yeah, we're gonna live forever 'cause we ain't afraid no more
Everything has always been what we're looking for

The only way out of this hell is through
So run and keep running fast
'Cause if you slow down, it'll ruin you
So keep running and never look back
You're not alone
You may be just like me, without a home
Lost and looking for something, but not alone
And if you're wondering, you're not alone
Yeah (Yeah)
Well, we're gonna live forever, and I've never felt so sure

Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show

Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk 'fore my mom wakes up
Break-up with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts
I'm Undead, unfed
Been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined

Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started

When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me and I like their big, thick titties
D cups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
Calm down, it's just a hickey, I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping
Gets me tipsy, drink fast and enjoy your buzz
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home but your friends won't let you
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer or pay the rent?
My signing bonus was quickly spent
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher

Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up

Let's get this party jumping
Let's see some 40 chugging
I wanna see your booty rubbing
Against my dick when I start buzzing
Come on girls, I wanna see you drinking
I wanna see your brains start shrinking
Make a move, I saw you winking
Drunken pussy's what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night till they call the cops
Fuck a wristband, let's all do keg stand
I'm like Cheech, you got the Chong, hitting up this beer bong
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker
Let's get this party started
Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)

 My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

Gone too far, yeah, I'm gone again
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of Gin
I'm twenty stories up, yeah, up at the top
I polished off this bottle, now it's pushing me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my mama found my letter, now she's calling the cops
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens, and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is
I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight, I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God, you know, you wanna look nice!
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

We hit the sky, there goes the light
No more sun, why's it always night?
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream
When you can't dream, well, what's life mean?
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and a son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don't
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
Or what happened to the father who swore he'd stay
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Now mama feels guilt, yeah, mama feels pain
When you were young, you never thought you'd die
Found that you could, but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see if you could fly
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

I wish that I could fly way up in the sky
Like a bird so high, oh, I might just try

Fuck the haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease

The boulevard, brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk-asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know, but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk

You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips

So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress

Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west

Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman, the voices keep asking
Born with this soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around, I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave
I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the Good Book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
This is Day of the Dead, and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits
Bitch, you're on our hit list

Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that candidly
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I feed you while laughing so happily
It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the Day of the Dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
And when I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry on the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

 I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be
How can I sleep at night? There's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion, and you are dead

Here's a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide, but some of us can never leave
And if you go, I don't need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words? All I can say
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You were born a lion, and a lion you will stay

I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be
Remember an army of all those little kids
Living life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle, and
I'd rather die, won't watch you giving in
I'm sorry, daughter, but your father's not the same
I can look into your eyes, and I'll swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow, so forgive me if I stay
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain
After all, only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once we walk away
Promise that you love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave
Put the hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion, and a lion I will stay

I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home, hey

 I loved you, you made me hate me, you gave me
Hate, see? It saved me, and these tears are deadly
You feel that? I'd rip back every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad? You feel sad? I'm sorry, hell no, fuck that
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies
And these lungs have sung this song for too long
And it's true, I hurt to remember I loved you

And I've lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

I wish I could've quit you, I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew and all the shit we've been through
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew
How could you do this to me? Look at what I made for you
It never was enough, and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts
And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And your tears are dried up now
You just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And my fears are over now
I can leave with my head down

And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you

 I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye

We gonna rise up to the top, we've been through it all
Been to fucking hell and back, our backs against the wall
Got the dove and grenade flag on display
And every fucking critic's gonna listen when we say
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye

So just understand nothing gets in my way
I can show you firsthand if you got something to say
If you think you can hold me down, you better think twice
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment every day of my life
These fucking people always say the same old thing
But you can't slay or conquer the king
I'm from a nightmare, but I'm living the dream
You need to back up if you're not with my team
'Cause I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine and I'mma take it

So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine

 We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

If you can lose it all, then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the marquee
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell, but it's getting real dark, see?
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath, you're breathing when I breathe
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I'm married to the devil in the city of angels
So come, all you wicked, to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so, baby, don't tempt me
I'm knocking on your door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checking all you bitches like I'm checking this check sheet
So put your hats on; Lohner, don't get soft
You can see God when I take my mask off

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts
The fame is your best friend, you love it, no questions
Beating down the door is the face of rejection
And once again, it's a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die
So grab a pick and an ax 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack, we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now?
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose
Just lie, motherfucker, till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what's ours)
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us
(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what's ours)
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts

From the city of angels (We are, we are)
An empty vessel of devils
Is there no one to save us? (We are, we are)
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us
From the city of angels (And our hearts, our hearts)
An empty vessel of devils
Is there no one to save us? ('Cause we are, we are)
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite

Johnny 3 and he's dipping in the four-door
.44 and it's pointing at your window
Ain't a good shot, here come four more
Getting hot, so I play in the snow
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things
See the dead on the cover of a magazine
See my smile, it was born from amphetamines
Better duck 'cause it's war on my enemies
Oh God, I think I lost it, oh no
Lost some, wanna watch the rest go
A madman when I'm mixed with SoCo
And who would've thought a man could sink to so low?
Now, who wants to die from the Mossberg shotty?
Putting holes in the hotel lobby
All you fake bitches are just another hobby
And I'll let you dig where I dump your body

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!
You know I got a grenade, and it's got your name on it
I'mma spit on your grave and engrave a dick on it
People say I'm insane and to put the brakes on it
Let me buy you a drink, how 'bout a roofie, gin, and tonic?
Yeah, Charlie Scene seems to be so hated
It's just me being intoxicated
'Cause being sober's so overrated
Hollywood Undead, what have you created?
I know that we have never really met before
But, tell me, does this rag smell like chloroform?
You know that I'm the reason people lock their doors
But I got nothing but time, so I'mma wait on the porch
You got nowhere to run too, so don't try hiding
'Cause I'm known to be like Jack Nicholson from "The Shining"
Yeah, I'm breaking your door down, so don't try fighting
Yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed, or the dead keep biting

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite
Wrap a rope around your head and watch you as you take flight
You better check twice, look under your bed
Turn on your night light and cover up your head
'Cause we do exist and there's no need to pretend
That you're not afraid of meeting the Undead
Red, redrum when you look into these eyes
Say goodnight 'cause it's almost your bedtime
Buckle up 'cause it's time to fly
You got a first-class ticket to Columbia neck ties
Take a seat, you can sit in the front row
The voice in your head is just me in your headphones
Everybody knows that we're the devil's heroes
Come and get a ticket, follow me to the creep show

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite
Wrap a rope around your head and watch you as you take flight
Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the dead bite

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

We only leave a pre-party to go party some more
I'm already shitfaced before I walk in the door
This girl's rubbing on my leg, I've never met her before
And now she's making her way down to my gentleman's sword
It might be the drugs talking or the shots of Patrón
But these bitches look like models, and they're ready to bone
I'll take 'em back to my parents' house, we'll be Home Alone
I'll slap them chicks and have 'em yelling like Macaulay Culkin
She's tearing it up, yeah, she's dancing her ass off
This girl's like a Mac the way she's riding my laptop
I'm tryna get my rocks off, so don't try to cock-block
Or I'll grab my sawed-off, and I'll blow your cock off
You know we drink so much, we're getting drunk for weeks
We drink so much Goose, we're turning into geese
Me and my crew fly the V through VIP
These bitches play my skin flute like they're Kenny G

Take shots, don't stop, sing along with it
I wanna feel you bounce, girl, go up and down
Take shots, won't stop till I'm passing out
So girl, get down, you can have more
And you can shake your hips around on my man sword
You're gonna have to rock this house, I'm your landlord
So let your sweat drip down on the dance floor
I ain't tryna go home with nolla, nolla
We can hit the dance floor when you wanna, wanna
Girl, you know you're feeling me so holla, holla
'Cause everyone compared to me is nada, nada
Okay, dawg, this has gone on for way long
Can't quit my day job till I'm played on K-ROQ
It's chaos, I'm in the club with my shades on
And I'm about to Smack That like I'm Akon
I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb

 Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

My body doused in ash
With two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have
Is a police sketch of my mask
And it's hard at times to ask
If you can save my heart for last
And it's hard to face the facts
When the darkness fades to black
It's not just make-believe
When they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines
In the air and make me breathe
So, come on and grab your children
Look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage
They're killin' by the millions
And billions of people die for a lost cause
So now I pray to my nation destroyed under God
It's the end of the world
All my battles have been won
But the war has just begun

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Till the skies bleed ashes
And the fucking skyline crashes
They catch us with matches, ignite the flame
And all the hopes of a youth deemed fucking insane
They say, "Take the pill, in God we trust
Go and kill, God loves us
As in life, as in death
Breathing till there is no breath"
I will not die in the night, but in the light of the sun
With the ashes of this world in my lungs
But who am I to say?
Let's all just run away
Grab your saints and pray
And we'll burn this world today
It's the end of the world
As in heaven, as on Earth
We've been dead since our birth

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll use the trees as torches
Do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll flood the streets with corpses
Do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll watch the city fucking bleed
Do you wanna burn it with me?
And bring the world to its knees
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world
Let's watch this city burn (let's watch it burn)
From the skylines on top of the world (let's watch it burn)
Till there's nothing left in her (let's watch it burn)

 It's a bad moon
A bad, bad moon
Haha

I wait till midnight, I can feel a cold breeze
A box of moonlight, a silhouette of palm trees
With one foot in the grave, beware of what I crave
My loneliness is the only bitch that holds me
No use in thinking 'bout it, don't need a reason
The moon is changing me, yeah, my heart is beating
You better run away before it gets too late
Black sunsets on the sky, and I'm thinking

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone home?
Hope you're awake for the nightmare
Hope you stay for the show

You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
You know how it is 'cause I'm just waiting on that bad, bad moon tonight
So take my hand now, I welcome you to my bad dream
Up in the clouds now, that bad moon comes, and it grabs me
I see the city below, this city is my soul
And when it takes to control, it's got me thinking these bad things
So let's not talk about it, I know the day is done
There ain't no getting 'round this, your ship is sinking
Get to your knees and pray, blue skies, they turn to grey
Black sun sets in your eyes, am I dreaming?

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone home?
Hope you're awake for the nightmare
Hope you stay for the show

You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
You know how it is 'cause I'm just waiting on that bad, bad moon tonight

Blacked out streets, looking like a wolf
Bad moon up, need to check my pulse
Creep in the woods, and I got you shook
Eyes locked in, gonna get you hooked
No look pass, coming up real fast
Sip up the flask, then I hit that gas
No time to crash, gonna make it last
Wake up inside in a cool black mask
Got gold fangs, I'm with my kin
No silver chain, it burns my skin
Hitting those threes, I was born to win
Pop from the trees, and I give you a grin
Check out the hair that grows out my skin
That's just the beast crawling within
Bloodstains on my fresh white Nikes
Oh my God, what the fuck did I do last night?
You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
You know how it is 'cause I'm just waiting on that bad, bad moon tonight6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Like a sinkhole, like a sinkhole
Stars aren't born, they're fucking made up in a dice roll
What does it show? What does it show?
C-C-Cut off all the tethers to your lost soul
Think about a time on a dotted line
Venice Beach, cutting throats on the shoreline
It ain't a fucking crime if I'm taking back what's mine
Los Angeles, we're on the front line
Click-click-boom, let 'em fall
Lining 'em up with the semi-matic auto
Hear the call? Hear the call?
Hop in the whip, d-dip it straight then I'm out though
When I do it like this
With a wiffle ball bat
Surf's up, bitches, and it's like that
Hollywood coming to attack

I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart
We never sleep; in California, we're dreaming
Running through the dark, broken boulevards
We never sleep; in California, we're dreaming
In California, we're dreaming

Armageddon now, Armageddon now
Coked out skeletons come back down
Break 'em down, gotta break 'em down
Broke down fault lines sink so loud
The greatest story ever told, the greatest lie I've ever known
Dead men walking audition for the big show
It's biblical; so, so cynical
In the land of make-believe, the situation's critical
Sink into the ocean like some martyrs at our pinnacle
Yeah, it's just a vision, but the waves are fucking literal
As above, so below
You wanna go to heaven, but you sold your soul
Dying young, I'm growing cold
Cut yourself apart so you don't grow old
We're living in denial, but we're doing it in style
Out here in California, it's a trial by fire
I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart
We never sleep; in California, we're dreaming
Running through the dark, broken boulevards
We never sleep; in California, we're dreaming
In California, we're dreaming

I can feel the tension hidden in the question
Underneath the dreams I hold
I can see rejection in my own reflection
I can feel my dreams grow cold
Dreams grow cold, oh

I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart
We never sleep; in California, we're dreaming
Running through the dark, broken boulevards
We never sleep; in California, we're dreaming
In California, we're dreaming

In California
In California, we're dreaming
In California13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I can't believe that when I breathe
There's something good inside of me, just one good thing inside
So close to me, that memory
Of that one good thing inside of me, just one good thing inside of me, yeah

If I ran out the backdoor, nobody would stop me, but where would I go?
'Cause I ain't ever had a real home, so what do I know?
So I could keep running, hide until they find me, but what would that do?
If they could only know what I knew, what would it prove?
I should've seen the writing on the wall, instead I'm left to fall
'Cause the longer I'm away, the more we stay the same
Looking back, would've thought I knew it all
Instead I'm left to fall, did I throw it all away?

I can't believe that when I breathe
There's something good inside of me, just one good thing inside
So close to me, that memory
Of that one good thing inside of me, just one good thing inside of me, yeah

Don't you know, little boy, they'll lay you to waste, man?
Little do they know every song has a lifespan
Never taken one, but I'm taking my last chance
To hold all we know and let go with both hands
So don't you know the clouds are made from concrete?
Right through the stone, can you hear my heartbeat?
Beats through my bones like the memory left me
Not for a second or a minute when I dream
I wanna go home like the home that I keep
You can dig six or sixty-six feet
We could live forever, still your misery missed me
Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey
Look into the mirror at the lines that time drew
See them painted white and the eyes that shine through
My heart beats heavy in an open chest
And I wanna say goodbye, but there's nobody left
I can't believe that when I breathe
There's something good inside of me, just one good thing inside
So close to me, that memory
Of that one good thing inside of me, just one good thing inside of me, yeah

I broke it all, and I put it to the test
Put your hand on mine, and feel this emptiness
There's no beat in my chest 'cause there's nothing left
No, it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress
What's another dream? You can hardly sleep
Can you believe bad things only happen to me?
God knows one day you will finally see
That scars will heal but were meant to bleed
Do you realize I would lie for you?
Please, have my last breath, I would die for you
I know I'm no good, but my heart beats true
You know I'm gonna fight, though I might be scared to lose
You took me in, and I fucked it up again
An empty promise? No, I won't pretend
'Cause in the end we need someone to solve 'em
Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem

I can't believe that when I breathe
There's something good inside of me, just one good thing inside
So close to me, that memory
Of that one good thing inside of me, just one good thing inside of me, yeah19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I've been searching for an answer, but I ain't found one
I've been known to tear shit up and go off like a gun
I've been drinking way too much, but now I think I'm done

Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet
Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet

I gotta get, I gotta get that feeling
Gotta get higher than the 20-foot ceiling
Just outta rehab, primed for a relapse
Had to do three dabs just so I could relax
Walk in the room and I check for bitches
Check my .44, check my ammunition
Got all my homies here, and that's fucking bitching
We got more pots than your fucking kitchen
Cooking shit up with the heat up high
With your middle fingers up, let the cops stroll by
No motherfucker here is drunker than I
And if we get drunk enough, we can set it on fire
Like fuck it, I don't wanna come down
I wanna get fucked up right about now
Gonna tear shit up, I don't wanna fight it
Who the fuck here wants to start a riot?
I've been searching for an answer, but I ain't found one
I've been known to tear shit up and go off like a gun
I've been drinking way too much, but now I think I'm done

Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet
Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet

Roll up to the party in my grandma's Chrysler
Jump into your circle 'cause I'm dying to cipher
The older I get, I'm like wine, I get finer
And I can tell your girl wants Charlie inside her
I'm a ride-or-dier with that eye of the tiger
Cornrows banging out the side of my visors
I'm so damn tight, they should call me the Scheister
Hitting bud and Budweiser, shit, I couldn't get higher
You done turned me into the "Swan Song" Charlie
Peeling out on a Harley at a high school party
Got a frame like Bane, call me young Tom Hardy
I'm the fucker to blame for the Undead Army
Got the fire tonight 'cause my ass got laid
Now I'm high and tight like my flat top fade
Mixed some Molly and Xanax and Tanqueray
And I'm fucking bad bitches like every single day
I've been searching for an answer, but I ain't found one
I've been known to tear shit up and go off like a gun
I've been drinking way too much, but now I think I'm done

Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet
Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet

Tear it up, burn it down
Pour them drinks up until we drown
Cold night, every day
And when you walk into the party, make sure you say

Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet
Fuck that shit, let's start a riot
Tear shit up, fuck peace and quiet12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Fuck it, fuck every single memory
How you done wrong, but who's the real enemy?
You better figure out not a single thing is meant to be
The only thing that matter's how you live before you're put to sleep
That's how you're living if you're living just to breathe
I never waste a sentence, better listen when I speak
Or you're gonna know the truth when they put you underneath
And no one's gonna listen when you're six feet deep
I keep my heart tucked in my chest
I hide it underneath with a bulletproof vest
Who's next? I, no, I never gave a fuck
I was too busy dying, too busy giving up

Yeah, trust me, just breathe
One day you're gonna see
Yeah, trust me, just breathe
Otherwise, you're living on your knees

This is your life, it's do or die
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision
This is your life, it's slipping by
You try to run but fall again, you get back up, that's living
Every day I feel like I wanna forget
And everywhere I go, I see the angel of death
To the left, I see what's right, b-but I hold it in the wrong hand
It's a fight, I see my life given no chance
It's hard to wake up, but I wanna believe
That I'm not alone with a broken dream
All the glitter ain't gold, don't be naive
Leave it all behind, just follow me

Yeah, trust me, just breathe
One day you're gonna see
Yeah, trust me, just breathe
Otherwise, you're living on your knees

This is your life, it's do or die
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision
This is your life, it's slipping by
You try to run but fall again, you get back up, that's living

Today, I finally felt like I wasn't in a dream
This ain't who I am inside or how it's supposed to be
My mind is on an endless road, and I've been losing sleep
And as the road is trembling, these demons start to creep
I can't hold back, you couldn't stop me if you tried
You should know that and when the fire burns inside
You can't hold back anything that never dies
You should know that, you can't hold back
This is your life, it's do or die
The sun may never rise again, so be the light, the vision
This is your life, it's slipping by
You try to run but fall again, you get back up, that's living7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I fall to pieces because I'm already broken
The words, they come, but then they softly go unspoken
You walk the lonely path, the only path you've chosen
Every moment's taken away and every second's stolen
Can't hold on, but I won't let go of everything I'm holding
When you feel it too, I hope you second that emotion
Your dreams are slipping by because your eyes are always open
Life is like a gun, it's not the only one that's loaded

Your life can end inside a moment
It slips by the more you try to hold it
It's alright 'cause everybody knows it
Life's like a trigger when you pull it like a bullet

Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang

The days are getting shorter, infinite in disorder
Swimming in the torture, sanity is on the border
No time to wonder why, why I'm not afraid to die
My crimes won't satisfy, so who's got time to say goodbye?
Every time I'm losing control, lose a little piece of my soul
Too late for me to crawl up out this hole, so, come on, let's go
Ain't no way to justify, this life keeps rushing by
It's hard to stay alive, but at least you know I fucking try
Your life can end inside a moment
It slips by the more you try to hold it
It's alright 'cause everybody knows it
Life's like a trigger when you pull it like a bullet

Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang

You'll never live until you know that you could die
You'll have to walk before you try to fly
You'll never know what's real in life until you pull it
Never see it coming like a bullet, like a bullet, like a bullet

Sometimes the truth can hurt inside
Don't you ever wonder why?
Let me know when it's time to pull it
I'll pull you through this bullet
You wanna know what it's like to fly?
Buy yourself a pretty life
Let me know when it's time to pull it
I'll pull you through this bullet
You wanna live before you die?
Sell yourself a pretty life
Let me know when it's time to pull it
I'll pull you through this bullet
Now I'll pull you through this bullet
Your life can end inside a moment
It slips by the more you try to hold it
It's alright 'cause everybody knows it
Life's like a trigger when you pull it like a bullet

Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang

 'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home

I fucking swear that I care, but it's hard when you stare
Into the bottom of a bottle that is empty and bare
Oh, my desolate soul in my desolate home
It's my desolate role, yeah, I'm here all alone
I can't think of a reason to get the fuck out of bed
Curtains closed, lights are off, am I alive or dead?
I haven't shaved in a week, I always slur when I speak
Tolerance at its peak, another fifth just to sleep
Oh, woe is me, woe is me, I guess I need love
And hoes you see, hoes you see, I'm just in a rut
And I swear I'm trying, baby, please, baby, don't leave
Goddamn, I'm a fuck up but I guess that's just me
So I sit in my room and I cry in my bed
Thinking about all the shit that made me wrong in my head
I keep trying to climb, but it seems so steep
Pour myself a fucking whiskey and go back to sleep, bitch
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home

I watch my mama cry, she says "baby, why?"
I say "baby died, baby's gone like a suicide"
I don't think you'll see him soon, Mom, stay out my room, Mom
Tell Daddy that I hate that motherfucker like you, Mom
I sing this shit for you Danny, Sascha, and Jordon
These beers keep getting warmer every time that I hold 'em
I pour this out for you like a partner in crime
It's a part of the times when you're sick in the mind
Yeah, I'm sick, oh, so sick, I'm so sick of this shit
Yeah, I'm lit, oh, so lit, I'm so fucked up off it
So I stumble around till I stumble fall down
Into this puddle of my tears laying here on the ground
When you've got nothing left you've got nothing left to lose
With my last, this single breath, I'll still be singing to you
So when you bury me, man, you better bury me deep
And sing along to this song 'cause you're broken like me
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home

And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong all along
And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong all along

'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home
'Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been running these streets for too long now
I've got nothing, it's true, but this song now
But the further I go, I wanna go home10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Bitches, I hope you know

And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone

Yo, I'm up in the club and the party's jumping
Bitches passing by and they're eyeball-fucking
I'm drinking Cristal, now they're trying to kiss me
Saying, "Funny Man, can you sign my titties?"
Now I got four bitches in the back of my Rover
The Fantastic Four saying "Funny, can I blow you?"
Three were preppy and one was scene
So three for me and one for Charlie

This girl's seventeen, now I'm a pedophile
Now she's showing me her tits, I think this girl's gone wild
I whipped out my dick, and her jaw hit the floor
Acting like she never seen a magnum before (Charlie!)
Turn off the lights and now I'm gonna film it
Turn on the night-vision like she's Paris Hilton
Funny Man walked in and said, "Chupa mi pito"
Then she munched on his dick like a macho burrito (Fuck yeah!)
Bitches, I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, ho
Baby, come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
Bitches, I hope you know

Now I'm Cadillaxing, candle waxing
I like your fat ass, bitch, grab my jacket
And grab a taxi, get in the backseat
Fuck, suck dick, lick, man we nasty
Drive fast please 'cause this booze is not lasting
One too many shots and I seem to be passing
I think this chick is down, yeah, she's down for the threesome
I call the homie J just to see if he needs some

J-J-J-Just got back coming from the bar
Rubbing on this chickie's titties in the back of her car
But, but your first mistake: you said you liked my band
The second was you put my Undead dick in your hand
And I'm taking secret pics on my cellular phone
I got my fingers in places where they don't belong (Wrong hole!)
Horny as fuck, pressing my luck
Need my dick sucked, so bitch give it up! (Yeah!)
Bitches, I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, ho
Baby, come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone
Bitches, I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, ho
Shorty, come say hello
And get your drunk ass over here, let's bone

Let's both get faded 'cause you know that I want you
Let's both get naked, girl, you know that you want to
Baby, we can have a party tonight
I wanna hit it cause I know that it's tight
Baby, we can have a party tonight
I wanna hit it all night, all night, all night, all night

Bitches, I hope you know
I won't stop till I hit that, ho

 We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky, I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it
I watch the beauty of all our lives, passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt
We get so sick, we're so sick, we never wanted all this
Medication for the kids with no reason to live

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart
As we walk among these shadows in these streets, these fields of battle
Take it up, we wear the mantle, raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark; in the rain, you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home
But you take all we are, the innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the altar as you tear us apart

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (we will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (we will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out of my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won't because I left it all behind
Now I'm stuck with this, and that'll never change
Always a part of me until the very last day
Where to go from here? What road to travel on?
I spent my whole life choosing, and it always chose wrong
Will I try to have the will to be alive?
Will I try 'cause I've never seen the light?
Lowered to the ground, and it's now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

How long can I keep pretending to be
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me?
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words but a man of few deeds
Walking these streets so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand, then we're walking away
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up, you know, it's darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

Look into my eyes and I see, what do I see?
Nothing at all
Take another look around me, what do I see?
Nothing at all

Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now
Can you hear me, hear me now?15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I need the bright city lights as I start to descend
'Cause I keep it Undead till the very end
And I got some low lifes that I call my friends
It's some West Coast, beach bum, gangsta shit
Fuck a Hollywood hit, I'll ghost ride the whip
On the Sunset Strip, just me and my clique
And we running the streets, so suck my dick
Six deep we creep, into the streets, we go
Cadillacs and Chucks, so we ready to roll
Just a couple of gangstas, Mimosas in Big Gulps

The best duo since Spade and Farley
Let's roll, hop in the whip and get gnarly
We blaze more spliffs than a young Bob Marley
Get some, yeah, get your dick sucked
I'm blazing a quick one in the back of a strip club
You're our victim forced into a sixsome
And ain't nobody leaving till all of our dicks cum
So kick back when I flash this gat
I got more straps than Matt's assless chaps
So hands up, yeah, we're lying 'em low
All cocked up and we're ready to go

 Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

I woke up feeling the same way
That I did yesterday
Don't know what these tears would say
But I miss my friend that went away
I watch the seasons as they go
The rain, the sun, the heat, the snow
I don't know much, but this I know
I miss my friend, I miss him so
I say my prayers, I raise my hands
I move my feet and when I can
I said "Help, won't you help me now
And lift me up if my legs give out?"
'Cause I know that life is short
And living is the hardest part
And someplace through the dark
We will meet and never part
Someplace through the dark

Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

The calm that comes before the break
The sun that sets like yesterday
The good may come and go away
While bad news waits for you to wake
We all kneel down before the storm
When waves come crashing at your door
I've been down, been down before
And I have faith, but I need more
We're specks of dust caught in a whirlwind
Nothingness behind the curtain
Life is short, but death is certain
That will always be our burden
Free, afraid to follow
If I promise you tomorrow
See through the dark
We will meet and never part
Someplace through the dark

Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

I had something to say
But the words went away
Just like they always do
I'll be there with you

Can you see me, my love, up there above?
When you were dying, I was dying too
Looked for meaning in song, but the meaning was gone
'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake

 I'm holding on so tightly now
My insides scream so loud
They keep watching, watching me drown
How did it come to this?
How did it come to this? How did I know it was you?
It was a bad dream asphyxiated, watch me bleed
The life support was cut, the knot was too tight
They push and pull me but they know they'll never win

Throw it all away, throw it all away
I keep on screaming but there's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting but I can't keep going on this way

I can't keep going, can't keep going on like this
They make me sick, and I get so sick of it
'Cause they won't let me, they won't let me breathe
Why can't they let me be?
Why can't they let me be? Why don't I know what I am?
I force this hate into my heart 'cause it's my only friend
My lips are sewn shut, I watch myself bleed
They push and pull me and it's killing me within
Throw it all away, throw it all away
I keep on screaming but there's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting but I can't keep going on this way

I can't keep going, can't keep going on this way
I can't keep going, can't keep going on this way

My heartbeat stumbles and my backbone crumbles
I feel, is it real, as the lynch mob doubles
They want blood and they'll kill for it, drain me and they'll kneel for it
Burn me at the stake, met the devil, made the deal for it
Guillotine dreams, yeah, their guillotine gleams
The blood of their enemies watching while they sentence me
Sentencing ceased, sentence deceased
And watch them bask in the glory of their holy disease

Throw it all away, throw it all away
I keep on screaming but there's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting but I can't keep going on this way
I keep on running, I keep on running
I keep on running but I can't keep going on this way

 When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)

 Long ago, just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave, and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide?

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way

 They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah
They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
All together now

"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me

 Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now!

But I'm okay, I'm okay!
I'm okay now, "I'm okay now," but you really need to
Listen to me, because I'm telling you the truth!
I mean this, I'm okay! "Trust me..."

So sick and tired of all the needless beating

I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

Of water, 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my Aunt Marie, help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors

'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo

All the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvie halls

Ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up

And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life

And if you get to Heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this

Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh, take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?

Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand?
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?

And in my honest observation, during this operation
Found a complication in your heart, so long
'Cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?

 For what you did to me, and what I'll do to you
You get what everyone else gets, you get a lifetime, go!
Let's go!

Do you remember that day, when we met?
You told me this gets harder, well, it did
Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies

The damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I’m taking back the life you stole

We never got that far, this helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
Just you and I, your starless eyes remain

Hip-hip-hooray for me, you talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep? Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary, we could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

This hole you put me in wasn't deep enough
And I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places
To hide from me

When you go, just know that I will remember you!
If living was the hardest part, we'll then, one day, be together!
And in the end, we'll fall apart just like the leaves changing colors!
And then I will be with you, I will be there one last time now!
When you go, just know that I will remember you!
I've lost my fear of falling, I will be with you, I will remember you!22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
Night, uh, they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're, they're these terrors

And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat and squeezing and
It's like, as if like somebody was gripping my throat"

Some say now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part
Is letting go of your dreams

A drink for the horror that I'm in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye

And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part's
The awful things that I've seen
"Sometimes I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always
I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"
Just sleep
"Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"

I see people that I love dying and it's always"

 Hand in mine, into your icy blues
And then I'd say to you, "We could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition, too"
I'd end my days with you, in a hail of bullets

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things
We put each other through and

I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you, and we'll keep it running

But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade and nights grow
And we grow cold
Until the end, until this pool of blood
Until this, I mean this, I mean this, until the end of

All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this
All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this
All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this
All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this


As lead rains will pass on through
Our phantoms forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame
We're burning forever and ever
Know how much I want to show you
You're the only one
Like a bed of roses
There's a dozen reasons in this gun
And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever!32EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 This night, walk the dead
In a solitary style and crash the cemetery gates
In the dress your husband hates
Way down, mark the grave
Where the searchlights find us drinking by the Mausoleum door
And they found you on the bathroom floor

I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

Back home, off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun staring down a loaded gun
So I won't stop dying, won't stop lying
If you want, I’ll keep on crying
Did you get what you deserve?
Is this what you always want me for?

I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

Way down, way down, way down, way down
Way down, way down, way down, way down
I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
When will I miss you? When will I miss you so far?

 Oh baby, here comes the sound!
Took a train outta New Orleans
And they shot me full of ephedrine
This is how we like to do it in the murder scene
Can we settle up the score?
If you were here, I'd never have a fear
So go on, live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday

(You're beautiful!)
Well, I'm a total wreck, and almost every day
Like the firing squad or the mess you made
Well, don't I look pretty walking down the street
In the best damn dress I own?
If you were here, I'd never have a fear
So go on, live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
You're so far away
So c'mon, show me how
'Cause I mean this more than words can ever say

Some might say we are made from the sharpest things you say
We are young and we don't care (Whoa-oh)
Your dreams and your hopeless hair (Whoa-oh)
We never wanted it to be this way for all our lives
Do you care at all?

If you were here, I'd never have a fear

 Stay out of the light or the photograph that I gave you
You can say a prayer if you need to
Or just get in line and I'll grieve you
Can I meet you alone?
Another night and I'll see you
Another night and I'll be you
Some other way to continue
To hide my face

Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those

Only go so far 'til you bury them
So deep and down, we go

Touched by angels, though
I fall out of grace
I did it all, so maybe
I'd live this every day
Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
It ain't the money and it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies I claim and those

Only go so far 'til you bury them
So deep and down, we go

Down, and down we go, and down we go, and down we go
And we all fall down! I tried! I tried!

And we'll all dance along to the tune of your death
We'll love again, we'll laugh again, and it's better off this way

And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots
To the back of the head and we're all dead now
And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots
To the back of the head and we're all dead now

I tried! One more night, one more night!
Well, I'm laughing out, crying out, laugh out loud!
I tried, well, I tried, well, I tried, 'cause I tried, but I lied, I lied!
I tried, I tried, I tried, well...
And we'll love again, we'll laugh again
We'll cry again, and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way, so much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed!

And never again and never again, they gave us two shots

 Gaze into her killing jar, I'd sometimes stare for hours

She even poked the holes so I can breathe

She bought the last line, I'm just the worst kind
Of guy to argue with what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?

Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

I'm lost in the prescription, she's got something else in mind (Something else in mind)
Check into the Hotel Bella Muerte

It gives the weak flight, it gives the blind sight
Until the cops come or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?
Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time
Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Pull the plug, but I'd like to learn your name

Slip into the tragedy
You've spun this chamber dry

Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living

 Well, they encourage your complete cooperation
Send you roses when they think you need to smile
I can't control myself because I don't know how
And they love me for it, honestly, I'll be here for a while

So give them blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
Give them all that they can drink, and it will never be enough
So give them blood, blood, blood
Grab a glass, because there's going to be a flood

A celebrated man amongst the gurneys
They can fix me proper with a bit of luck
The doctors and the nurses, they adore me so
But it's really quite alarming, 'cause I'm such an awful fuck (Oh, thank you)

I gave you blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
I gave you all that you can drink, and it has never been enough
I gave you blood, blood, blood

 The lies, the weight
Deceit, decay
The lies, the weight
It's clear I lost my way
Deceit, decay
Decomposing

I thought I was an architect, but I was just moving dirt
Stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt
I hadn't been building
The time was spent digging
Boring the barriers that kept others away
The deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear, hear me fall

So now I know there is no one else to blame

Buried alive inside of my own grave
And there's no one else to blame
Buried alive inside of my own grave
Inside of my own grave

Beneath my lies
Delusional enough to think I'd designed something great
Like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate
I hadn't been building
The time was spent digging
An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape
Nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what I'd become
Buried alive inside of my own grave
And there's no one else to blame
Buried alive inside of my own grave
What I'd become
Buried alive inside of my own grave

Beneath my pride crushing me
Beneath my lies collapsing
But we are still alive
We are still alive

Buried alive inside of my own grave
And there's no one else to blame
Buried alive inside of my own grave
My own grave

Buried alive inside of my own grave
And there's no one else to blame
The lies and the weight, I know I lost my way
What I'd become
Buried alive inside of my own grave
And there's no one else to blame
Buried alive, buried alive
Finally forced to face what I'd become
What I'd become in my own grave
Buried in my own grave alive8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I refuse to let go of the memories
'Cause they've changed everything inside of me

If I could go back now to save myself the loss
Substanceless character brought back would be the cost
Agony today is tomorrow's strength
So don't run away 'cause misery is
Evolving into something that we can't see
Evolving and becoming, transforming
So don't run away

The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength, turn it into strength

What do we value in the midst of complacency?
But in despair, we beg for something, anything
Even our mistakes can have the power
To light the way like a glaring tower

The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength
From our failures, we are refined
Replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined
Healed scars can be stronger than skin
The wounds we have can be rewritten
Redefined, redefined, redefined
Agony today is tomorrow's strength, redefined
So don't run away

The pain can never be erased

The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength
The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength
From our failures, we are refined
Replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined
From our failures we are refined

 The wise before me chose to refine themselves
Melt away their shortcomings by enduring trials
A process we will all undertake
Even if we try to prevent change

Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within

Like iron shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
We aren't born, we aren't born this way
We are reborn, we are reborn through pain

Though I too have endured fire
I wasn't wise enough to ignite the flame myself
But carried enough fuel for a flicker to excel

Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within
Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within
Shaped by fire, we aren't born this way

Shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
Through pain we are reborn, we are reborn through pain

The time has come to watch the fire grow
Find new things to throw in, don't let the flames get low
I've grown used to the heat that makes me reevaluate
What I carry with me and what should be thrown away

Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within

Like iron shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain

 Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Blinded, blinded by the pain

Unwilling to see, senseless
So blinded by selfishness
Only focusing on myself
And ignoring anyone else
Becoming driven by despair
Feeling trapped into a corner
Losing more and more of reality
Perceiving all the hurt only one-sidedly

Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Losing yourself inside the heartache

Losing yourself
Feeling too powerless to change
Stuck and unable to escape
Incapable to see another way
I need someone to shake me, to wake me
I don't even need full clarity
Just to start the shift from blind to blurry
Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Losing yourself inside the heartache
And does that mean we cannot change?
Or will we always be seen that way?

Will we always be seen that way?
And does that really mean we have not changed?

Or does it only mean
The truth is not in how we're seen?
But in the actions that we're now determined to take
Revealing the new path we chose to mend the heartache
Was it a pattern or a disastrous mistake?
Is the truth in what you see or what I say?

Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Losing yourself inside the heartache
And does that mean we cannot change?
Or will we always be seen that way?

Held in Your arms, but too far from my heart
Held in Your arms, but too far from my heart

While your eyes rest in

And the way you drew, drew me close with one, deep sigh
Scattering pieces of my, my restless mind
Forgetting all, that we, have left, left, behind

We are overfed and under, undernourished, yearning for something more
Never starving yet never quite satisfied
Carnal but without useful flesh or mind
I am a walking contradiction that's found consistency
Consuming everything, all without producing sustenance
In the parallels we struggle, struggle to upkeep
There is a better way for us to be set free
From all it is we crave, there must be more to life than to simply stay alive
To simply stay alive
We are not the same as I hope to show
There is a better way if we just let go
We are not, we are not the same

Let go
In the tension between devouring want or simple need
It's clear the only lines between the ones we preserve

When your ambition calls you, calls you!
For what use is there, is there in praying
If you will only hear what you want to hear?

We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us?
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?
There is no difference between us and them
If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments

Taking me places I cannot remember (remember)

 Pulled both ways, but still suspended
The worst of each, reduced and blended
Still suspended, suspended

I thought I was stuck between two worlds
Because I was not willing to let go
Recklessly pulled both ways
But somehow still suspended
The worst of each, reduced and blended
But as life unfolded, I realized
The momentum to drift from side to side
Came from within, came from inside

I feel torn between two hearts dying, but I'll trade them in for one
Broken and exposed, collapsing, so why would I hold on?

One heart turned black, the other blue and bruised
Arms breaking, arms breaking from the dreams
Dreams shattered, the dreams that I can't reach
There has to be, there has to be a choice I have not seen

I feel torn between two hearts dying, but I'll trade them in for one
Broken and exposed, collapsing, so why would I hold on?
I feel torn between two hearts dying, but I'll trade them in for one
One darkened over time burning away the shame
Erasing hidden insights I did not want to be seen
The other was beaten from being exposed
So it hurt less to never hold it close

I feel torn between two hearts dying, but I'll trade them in for one
Broken and exposed, collapsing, so why would I hold on?
I feel torn between two hearts dying, but I'll trade them in for one
So why would I hold on? I'll trade them in for one

Or be the source of who I want to be

 Reality no longer battles perception
This letter's written to no one

Sincere
I sought your truth and divine purpose
Through myths of revelation
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box
Supported only so long
As my mind was the enemy
I could not in conscience hold on

As we face distress
We must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on
Triumph awaits
As we face distress
We must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on
Triumph awaits us

The powerful constant that I had once leaned on is no longer there (No longer)
You call this shameful disbelief
A process like losing my closest friend
As we face distress
We must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on
Triumph awaits
As we face distress
We must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on
Triumph awaits us

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart
Before we can rebuild them again
A greater foundation
We watch our whole lives
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives
Fall apart
Before we can rebuild them again (rebuild them again)
A greater foundation

I wish there was another way
But no amount of devotion can fix this
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart
Before we can rebuild them again (rebuild them again)
A greater foundation (We watch our whole lives fall apart)
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives (Rebuild them again)
Before we can rebuild them again

Artist:As I Lay Dying, 
 The life that I sought was already like a jail
Long before I was ever bound

Wrapped up in chains
No one had built the bonds
Use to hold me captive
I had locked away myself in a captain-less ship
Destined to destroy ashore
Destruction was my savior
Crushing collapse
Crashing from the impact

I can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
But I keep fighting to get away
The undertow that's pulling me, pulling me

My control disappeared
'Cause it was never real

Aboard a ship with nowhere to go
Guided by lifelessness, a skeleton without a soul
Crushing collapse, looming ahead
Crashing is imminent from the impact
I can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
But I keep fighting to get away
The undertow that's pulling me, pulling me
I can't escape the undertow that's pulling me, pulling me

Though I found freedom when
I stopped fighting everyone else
And loosened up the anchor
That I had tied around myself
I let go of the chains, chains
Just let go of the chains
I let go of the chains used to hold me in
My addictions killing me from within

I can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
But I keep fighting to get away
The undertow that's pulling me, pulling me
I can't escape the undertow that's pulling me
But I keep fighting to get away
The undertow that's pulling me, pulling me

Just let go of the chains, chains
I let go of the chains used to hold me in my addictionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:As I Lay Dying, 
 The wreckage seemed too great for me
I saw my dreams collapsing, collapsing
But through debris, the tragedy
Not one of us died fighting
The wreckage

We somehow found a way through storming weather
Enduring skies turned grey when we all said never
The winds, the rain
Downpour needed to cultivate

We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning, drowning?
The wreckage

So use the storms ahead to flood out shortcomings
And then use what is left to water what is worth planting
The winds, the rain
Downpour needed to cultivate
Debris, tragedy
But not one of us died, but not one of us died fighting
We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning?

Will we fight or just get washed away?
And now the mountains that we face are starting to look more like hills
We rose to a higher plain so the whole horizon fell
It fell, the whole horizon fell

Through the debris of tragedy
Not one of us died fighting, fighting

We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning?
We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning?
The wreckage that once seemed insurmountable to me
Is now becoming a part of rebuilding
We somehow found a way through storming weather
Enduring skies turned grey when we all said never
So use the storms ahead to flood out shortcomings
And then use what is left to water what is worth planting

Deep roots that refuse, deep roots that refuse
Deep roots that refuse, that refuse to break
Deep roots that refuse, refuse to break
Deep roots that refuse to break1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:As I Lay Dying, 
 I took what you gave me, destroyed it all
I  had to lose everything to know that I was wrong
And  now I see what was true all along
A void in me, now that everything is gone
Now that everything is gone

The  emptiness can be a source of clarity
Taking  away a way for us to hide, always revealing
No choice but to rebuild, no voice, no peace, no love, no home
Nothing  left to hold, nothing left but hope

Take my broken frame
What still remains free from the chains, free from the chains

Nothing left to hold, nothing left but hope
Like  hunting for prey that we don't even need to track
So easy to follow what's next, we are left with only one path, one path
No choice but to rebuild, no voice, no peace, no love, no home
Nothing left but hope

Take my broken frame
What still remains free from the chains, free from the chains
Take what's left in me, what's worth saving
No matter how much time it takes
From merely hope, we are brought back to life
From broken bones, we revive
Take what's left and create
Take what's left and then rebuild

You had every reason to give up on me
But you stood and waited when everyone ran away

I took your gifts, destroyed them all
And then lost everything to know that I was wrong
But you still carried me when you could barely walk
You reminded me I was never too far gone

Take my broken frame
What still remains free from the chains, free from the chains
Take what's left in me, what's worth saving
No matter how much time it takes
Take my broken frame
What still remains free from the chains, free from the chains

Take what's left
Take what's left and rebuild1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Forever your eyes will hold the memory
I saw your heart as it overtook me
We tried so hard to understand and reason
But in that one moment I gave my heart away
I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away
With that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me
And all I knew is what had overtaken me
With no reason I am comforted by inability to understand
Forever your eyes will hold the memory
I saw your heart as it overtook me
We tried so hard to understand and reason
But in that one moment I gave my heart away
I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away
Forever your eyes will hold the memory
Forever your eyes will hold the memory
Forever your eyes will hold the memory

Will your smile still open my heart
And leave me transparent?

 You've lost touch
You've lost touch with the outcasts

Have you forgotten your own past?
Have you forgotten that your house is made of glass?
So while you're pointing your fingers
You are unable to use your hands
To help with solving
Solving real and present problems
'Cause we're appealing
And you've become too perfect to understand

You're a gatekeeper
Blocking the entrance to nowhere
You're a gatekeeper
Trying to keep others in despair, yeah
Trying to keep others in despair

I don't want you to get dirty reaching down to a lowly creature
I don't want you to show mercy and make me like you, self-righteous preacher
Did you think you were the only one
The only one who held the keys?
Did you hope that your judgement would
Spread just like a disease?
You're a gatekeeper
Blocking the entrance to nowhere
You're a gatekeeper
Trying to keep others in despair

The self-importance of the moral elite
To think that their approval means anything, yeah

So eager to capitalize
Capitalize on other people's pain
But when the healing begins
So quick to turn away
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten your own past?

You're a gatekeeper
Blocking the entrance to nowhere
You're a gatekeeper
Keeping others in despair1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Convinced I was in need

Only a slave to this
Tomorrow may fall
And today is already gone
I will no longer adore
These things that will never satisfy me
I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came
In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die
In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die
To die

 94 hours of regret
For me to realize what I held
Unfading beauty, not just a face
I held its innocence within my heart

Go!
Now I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
(Now I...) I won't let go
(Now I...) I won't let go

The torment of your eyes
Has awakened my soul
The torment of your eyes
Has awakened my soul
The pain of a moment's time
Will forever beg your forgiveness

Artist:As I Lay Dying, 
 There's a sentence they gave me
Then one that remains unchanging
Like skin that's burnt by frost, it'll peel if I pull away
It hurts to hold or let go as I'm trying to sustain
Like feeling hunger pangs and eating bone to stay alive
It tears me apart inside‚ but it seems like the better way to get by
Like a broken hourglass‚ they fell
Cutting sand through my fingers down the deepest well

I know the toll it takes‚ but I won't let you go
The past I can't replace is all that you'll ever know
There is no turning back, I can't fix what I broke
The past I can't replace is all that you'll ever know

You're a part of me that I may never be able to repair
Like a lung that's collapsed, I'll always know that you're still there
Always surrounding my heart even if it rejects air

I know the toll it takes‚ but I won't let you go
The past I can't replace is all that you'll ever know
There is no turning back, I can't fix what I broke
The past I can't replace is all that you'll ever know
The true sentence I still face is one I brought upon myself
Lost in a dark cell
They said it's easiest just to numb yourself and let go
But these open wounds will forever feel fresh
And I refuse to let them close yet

I know the toll it takes, but I won't let you go
The past I can't replace is all that you'll ever know
There is no turning back‚ I can't fix what I broke
The past I can't replace is all that you'll ever know

I know the toll it takes, but I won't let you goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 The worst form of illness is one that goes undiagnosed
Subtle  decay secretly spread a cancer of the soul
A  cancer, a cancer of the soul

We are all dying‚ some of us just faster than our friends
But pointing to a greater fault won't cure what we have hidden
I  used to be able to pretend‚ but I can no longer hide from who I am

My  deceit was displayed for all to see
The only thing that could've saved me

Only  after we've fallen
Can we then find the cure
Looking up from the bottom
When dust settles‚ it's clear
When  the dust settles, it's clear

It's so easy to believe that you are nothing like me
'Cause your deceit is lesser and yet to be seen
But doesn't that change what you're hiding?
Only after we've fallen
Can we find the cure
Looking up from the bottom
When dust settles, it's clear
Only after we've fallen
Can we then find the cure
Looking up from the bottom
When dust settles‚ it's clear
Only after we've fallen
Can we then find cure

We are all dying
A cancer of the soul
We are all dying
A cancer of the soul

A heart that is bound by snakes with a mind that sprouting wings
A dangerous combination that fails to address our infection

My deceit was displayed for all to see
The only thing that could have saved me
Only after we've fallen
Can we then find the cure
Looking up from the bottom
When dust settles, it's clear
Only after we've fallen
Can we then find the cure
Looking up from the bottom
When dust settles, it's clear
Only after we've fallen
We are all dying

But will we find the cure?
Only after we have fallen
Looking up from the bottom

 I've looked straight into your eyes
And turned my head for the last time
Because I was scared
To leave these walls in ruin like
The fate of those who trust
In themselves, we are
Alone and afraid
I know you are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
You're the one we've left behind
You're the one we've left be-
I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget you
You are the one we've left behind
You are the forsaken
We've built our confidence
On broken dreams now left for dead
Yet we've been condemned (Yet we've been condemned)
To chase these dreams that never end
I know you are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
You're the one we've left behind
You're the one we've left be-
I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget you
You are the one we've left behind
You are the forsaken
I will (I will) no longer turn my head
I will (I will) never forget you
You are (You are) the one we've left behind
You are (You are) the forsaken
Our selfishness consumes us until the whole world
Is not enough, forgive the day that I erased
That I erased your name, that I erased your name
For it's the memory of me that will decay
I know you are the forsaken
Somehow we are the ones who feel alone
I know you are the forsaken
Somehow we are the ones who feel aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 All we can do is heal
Or let it destroy us

Some of our wounds
Come from those around us
While some are self-inflicted
By thorns growing from within
But the story remains the same
Once we carry the hurt and shame
All we can do is heal
Or let it destroy us
(Destroy us)

The wounds that we’re left with
We cannot control
The curse of the pain
Feels like all we know
Until we find the strength
Drawn from the roots below
In blackened soil nеw power grows (grows)
New power grows

Sеntenced to a lesser life
For what we’ve been through?
Or growing in ways that we
Never thought possible before?
Cutting off what can’t survive
So we can let our weakness die
(So we can let our weakness die, die)
The wounds that we’re left with
We cannot control
The curse of the pain
Feels like all we know
Until we find the strength
Drawn from the roots below (roots below)
In blackened soil new power grows

Regeneration comes after death
And virtue from rooting out damage
Cut off what can’t survive


The wounds that we’re left with
We cannot control
The curse of the pain
Feels like all we know
Until we find the strength
Drawn from the roots below (roots below)

The way it is meant to be

Without the burden that's in our hearts
None of us would have ever found You
For You are faithful when we are not
You began a work
That only you can complete

Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers
And I'll always wonder why
Now this is who we are
I'll never know the answers
And I'll always wonder why

Why we're given grace we'll never deserve
And a second chance that we will never earn

For there is nothing I can do

 Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears (Come here you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in her
It goes on and on, and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
Baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize
From somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

I will suffer for so long
(What will you do? Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again
We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do)
Do you take this woman to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you

 Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life that healed the broken heart with all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could

Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growin' old
It seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it’s so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you’re so far away

I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you when He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
So far away
And I need you to know

 So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel, I appreciate the time, I'm not alone
(Why don't you get my lawyer on the phone?)
There were days these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?

As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(Yeah, everybody's got a sob story)
Jesus Christ was born to die
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby
I see your angle but we differ from our points of view
(So tell me, what's your cross to bear?)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today

Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm runnin' out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)

 He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I've known it from the start, all
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me, I'm
Too weird to live but much too rare to die20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
At where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Dear God, the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me, on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

Dear God, the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again
Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

Dear God, the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again32EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve the path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night (Night)
Death is riding into town with armor
They come to take all your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)
The King

Blood is spilled while holding keys to the throne
Born again but it’s too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light (Light)
Death is riding into town with armor
They come to grant you your rights
Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)
The King

There's a taste of fear (Hail, hail, hail)
When the henchmen call (Hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to tame them (Hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to claim it all

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)

 Our truth is painted across the sky
In our reflection we learn to fly
No hand to hold us
No one to save us from tomorrow

Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
No light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?

Think for a moment of all the lives
Stripped of their essence before their time
We stand to conquer
But is there nothing left tomorrow?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
No light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?
"We have one collective hope: the Earth; and yet, uncounted people remain hopeless
Famine and calamity abound
Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war
People kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s concept of God
Do we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us?
Each fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane
Every fictionalized dictator, biased or partisan, and wayward son
Are part of the curtains of society’s racial, ethnic, religious, national and cultural conflicts
And you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers
When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets and planets
Each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity
I see beyond the plight of humans
I see a Universe ever-expanding, with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching four-dimensional fabric of space and time
However big our world is, our hearts, our minds, our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger
There are more stars in the Universe than grains of sand on the world’s beaches
More stars in the Universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed
More stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived
The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuing of our species
In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment
Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective: a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above, nor below; but within"13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light, but girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see, so how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here
A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on Earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind
Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might take me back inside
When the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying
'Cause they’re already missing me
I pray by the grace of God
That there’s somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken, I’m choking on this ecstasy)
Oh, Lord, I’ll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live!)

I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
Take me back inside when the time is right40EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own

Don't you see I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be

Now you know I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the Kingdom of Redemption
Pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
Make way, the Shepherd of Fire

Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me its never too late

I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
I am your wrath, I am your guilt, I am your lust!
(And you know it's right)
I am your law, I am your scar, I am your trust
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 (Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off!)
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
So, how does it feel to know that
Someone's kid in the heart of America has blood on their hands
Fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle
That insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute
We aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you!)
(Shh be quiet, you might piss somebody off)
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you dug your own grave)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
All the way from the east to the west
We got this high society looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They never contributed a fucking thing
To the country they love to criticize
Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see, try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

(Shh! Be quiet, you might piss somebody off)

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men

 As the embers rose through the Roman sky
Tell me were you calm when they took your life?

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice, words forever shine

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

As they spoke your fate a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow

 Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, you're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change
I won't see you tonight
So far away, I'm gone
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

Essence left my heart tonight

 Oh!

Hey! Can't you see we're tripping on the wire
Walking through the candy land of our desires
Press the magic button and behold the world you crave
Where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, god damn
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm

Hey! It goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law no Horus eye
No one came to cuff you they just handed you the chains
Blind follows the blind and now the one-eyed man is king

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, god damn
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
No form of payment, no pot of gold will satisfy the debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses in a trance the children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away
And led them to the river for what was their final day
No need for convincing on his pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorn
And now the fire keeps us (keeps us)
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Skull!

(They all know, they all know)

Sorry, did I wake your dream?
Some questions run too deep
We only, only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
Lost our way tonight

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

(Save me)
I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me)
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me)
I'm losing my only dream
(Save me)
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
(They all know, they all know)

Ever since the day you left, my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

(Save me)
I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me)
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me)
I'm losing my only dream
(Save me)
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know

Help me find my way
Said help me find my way

No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing who I want to be
You'll find out, right now

He may be out of his mind, but someday you will find
That sanity's left us all blind, and dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die, I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind, then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind, and walked right through the door
I can see the pictures clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay, but know you're not alone

(Save me)
I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me)
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me)
I'm losing my only dream

 Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
The streets we traveled on will undergo our same lost past

I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you

I see my vision burn,  I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
Newborn life replacing all of us, changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?

I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real


So, what if I never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again?
Woah, so I never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
I beg don't leave me
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
I'm stuck here alone (Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)

 This shining city built of gold
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye 'round here
Look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The beast and the harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great

The city dressed in jewels and gold
Fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky
The beast and the harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant, you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Looking back on her to see there's nothing around
I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to Hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great
She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird

Far too many moons since you felt well and strong
You see, you could say goodbye but you don't have to die
Not ever

Architect a code so you won't feel the pain
With your family by your side and vigor in your eyes forever

 Took me years to make my motives clear
And the days have not been kind
Once a steady gaze and charming smile
Has been buried in the lines I find
I walk in the noise, quiet employs
And darkness seems to know just where I am

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die

There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow all the bullets bear my name

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago, I know
I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes
Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name?

 "I'll try"
She said as she walked away
Tried not to lose you
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
I'll be here waiting, tested and secure

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near
Oh!

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me

 We've been through hell, sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds, viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars that doomed our children to die

Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls

I'd make a decision if granted the privilege
But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize

You own the burg, we sleep in streets
You dine then waste, we forage to eat
Well who pays the tab when you cross the line?
Who writes the check? Who's herding the swine?
Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced

How can we see the outside of the pen when survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion

(Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head)
Dear radiation my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find in an illusion
It's an illusion2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Hey kid (Hey kid)
Do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family
Hey, there's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?
Can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Hey (Hey kid)
I have to question
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family
Hey, why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty re-run
Welcome to the family
I try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Gunning for you and all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic rabid dementia
I won't be fine

I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you've never known
Stand down, place your weapons by your side
It's our war, in the end we'll surely lose but that's alright
So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I've lost my
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside

Artist:Avenged Sevenfold, 
 I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face, I may have forced the scale to tip
I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) Come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face, but the fact remains that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin, but deep inside, I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall) Come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say (Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right (Make it all right)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane, hahahahaha
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all) Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson) Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But still you fall) Come back again, it's almost easy18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
Light-years above
(Take me higher)
Time seems to wait
(Take me higher)
Promise to see you again

It haunts to remember
All the memories of that day
Pre-flight demonstration
Led to desperate voices fueled by flames
Now I'm out here waitin'
Hoping you would send a sign
Came a million miles
And the earth grows small as I lovingly leave it behind

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend

We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreaming
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute
As we go flying past
Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
Light years above
(Take me higher)
Time seems to wait
(Take me higher)
Promise to see you again

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
Light years above
(Take me higher)
Time seems to wait
(Take me higher)
Promise to see you again

Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull

There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer


Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there

 This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive

Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah

No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Woah, you're a loaded gun

 This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
(And baby you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you


And I wasn't there when you were happy
(And I wasn't there to make you happy)
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for

 Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah


Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as

 On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you was living in another world trying to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway

There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)

I want to say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me
And that broken old street light
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words tonight

Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me 

I never knew I had a dream
Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies

You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me

Yeah 
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside

The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby

Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong
We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

 Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice

 My mama told me
When I was younger
You better speak up
Don't be a number
My daddy told me
When there was thunder
Go be the lightning
Don't run for cover

Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're all just looking
For a place that we call home

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down walls

The space between us
Is getting wider
We need the spark to
Light the fire
Show me the promise
Give me some feeling
There's too much hurting
We need some healing

Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're one step closer
To that place that we call home

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down these walls

I remember when the world was smaller
And we both felt 10 feet taller

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down these walls

Artist:Bon Jovi, 
 I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then, I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love songEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me, forgive your wayward son

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, mother
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please believe me
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough)
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Tell me, baby, when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me all's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride? Yeah

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, father
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please don't leave me
(Everybody's bleedin' 'cause the times are tough)
Well, it's hard to be strong when there's no one to dream on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you know it's never too late
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Oh, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been walking in the footsteps, of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more, sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever, to stand out in the rain
So no one sees me crying, trying to wash away this pain

Mother, father (Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
And every night we fall from grace
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough)
It's hard with the world in your face
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on
(Everybody needs, everybody, keep the faith)

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord you gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith)
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on, yeah
(Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith)
Everybody keep the faith
(Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

 Shot through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love

Would you be content to see me crying?
After all those little games you put me through
After all, I've done for you, you're lying
Wouldn't it be nice, to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call

And I'm shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of this game that we call love

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry, haha!
I just don't know who you're talking to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
I've grown up and now I'm over you
Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn
That I'm shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of this game that we call love


Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn?
Now you're shot

Baby does, baby, please
And baby must have what she sees
But not this time, the tables turned
And, baby, you just got burned

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game...

Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's okay
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (All night)
There's a chance we'll get by (And it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die

'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons

 I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days

She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy Shoes, he busted both his legs
Trying to learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, "Momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than f-f-fade away", yeah
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
There ain't nobody left but us these days

(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) I know Rome's still burning
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) Though the times have changed
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) This world keeps turning round and round and round and round these days


These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, love don't last, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, there ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
Oh no no no, ain't nobody left but us these days
Ain't nobody left but us these days

 I was born to be of service
Camp Lejeune just felt like home
I had honor, I found purpose
"Sir, yes, sir," that's what I know
They sent us to a place
I never heard of weeks before
When you're nineteen it ain't hard to sleep
In the desert on God's floor
Close your eyes, stop counting sheep
You ain't in boot camp anymore

We were taught to shoot our rifles
Men and women side by side
Thought we'd be met as liberators
In a thousand-year-old fight
I got this painful ringing in my ear
From an IED last night
But no lead-lined Humvee war machine
Could save my sergeant's life
Three more soldiers, six civilians
Need these words to come out right

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken
It's eighteen months now, I’ve been stateside
With this medal on my chest
But there are things I can't remember
And there are things I won't forget
I lie awake at night
With dreams the Devil shouldn't see
I wanna scream, but I can't breathe
And Christ, I'm sweatin' through these sheets
Where's my brothers? Where's my country?
Where's my "how things used to be"?

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken

My service dog's done more for me
Than the medication would
There ain't no angel that's comin' to save me
But even if they could
Today, twenty-two will die from suicide
Just like yesterday, they're gone
I live my life for each tomorrow
So their memories will live on
Once we were boys, and we were strangers
Now we're brothers and we're men
Someday, you'll ask me, "Was it worth it
To be of service in the end?"
Well, the blessing and the curses
Yeah, I'd do it all again

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, yeah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Tonight they're shutting down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rollin’ up their sidewalks
One less paycheck comin' through
I know you're feelin’ kinda nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothing's the same, this ain't a game
We gotta make it through

As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowin' kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It ain't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit homе in isolation
TV news is always on

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain’t my prayer, it’s just a thought I'm wanting to sеnd
’Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
The chicken farm from Arkansas bought workers PPE
Not before five hundred more had succumbed to this disease
Honest men and honest women workin' for an honest wage
I got a hundred point one fever, and we still got bills to pay

When you can’t do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

They built a hospital on East Meadow in Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers, grocery store clerks manning the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by
There by the grace of God go I

Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive, 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love

They can offer advice that you don't wanna hear
Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear
You think of them ignorant, they think of you arrogant
If you need evidence, who gave you confidence?

A snap of the finger and you're not a child
But you're still holdin' on as you walk down the aisle
When they give you away to hear someone else say
That someone will love you 'til their dyin' day

Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love
And that's the story of love

You can choose to remember or choose to forget
If they took you to school or they tucked you in bed
You can say it don't matter, you won't do the same
You'd think no one noticed when you looked away
Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love

Now they're getting older, and you ain't so young
So you take care of them like your daughters and sons
You can ask for forgiveness, they could ask for the same
Forget all the anguish, the heartache, the pain

Wherever you go or wherever you've been
It's them that is with you, and that's you that's with them
Fathers and daughters and mothers and sons
As one story ends, another's begun

Oh, fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love
From hello to goodbye, that's the story of love
That's the story of loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh-oh, oh-oh
The door is off the hinges, there's no wish in the well
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Outside the sky is coal black, the streets are on fire
The picture window's cracked, and there's nowhere to run
I know, I know, this house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for lookin' back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul, this house is not for sale
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

This house was built on trust
That's what it is, and always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

Coming home, I'm coming home

 You want commitment
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with fire (Yeah)
Until the end of time
And I would do anything
I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight

Baby I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
My blood, my love, my life
If you were in these arms tonight

I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
We stared at the sun
And we made a promise
A promise this world would never blind us
And these were our words
Our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers
These prayers keep me strong
And I still believe
If you were in these arms

I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

Your clothes are still scattered all over our room
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume
Everything here reminds me of you
And there's nothing that I wouldn't do

And these were our words
They keep me strong, baby!

I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time

If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms

Like the seasons need to change
Like a poet needs the pain
I need you

I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement and all the good shit's gone
Just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
My name is Billie Jean, my love is bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I'm getting paid

And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive

Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Now I can't say my name or tell you where I am
I want to blow myself away, don't know if I can
I wish that I could be in some other time and place
With someone else's soul, someone else's face

And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind

Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time

Hey hey hey hey, man, I gotta live my life
I'm gonna pick up all the pieces and what's left of my pride
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Someday I'll be Saturday night
I'll be back on my feet, I'll be doing all right
It may not be tomorrow, baby, that's okay
I ain't going down, I'm gonna find a way!

I see you thinking twice
Wish I could read your mind
Move up or out of line
Too late for praying
I know we might lose our breath
We might be scared to death
This chance is like a step
Just gotta take it
Oh, countdown to here we go

Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss, love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry-go-round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
Can't lie and won't pretend
I know what's 'round the bend
Too late to start again
Won't take it slower
Let's slip right off these tracks
We'll fly or we might crash
Don't look down, don't look back
'Cause it ain't over

Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss, love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry-go-round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster

Oh, countdown to here we go
So hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high the stars are on our shoulders

Morning comes, you do it all again
You know the song it's on repeat
Find your shoes, can't find your feet
Grab your wallet and your keys
Better not forget to breathe
Sweat until you're soaking
Don't let them see you choking
A teardrop in the sea

Is there something more

There's an open door

That I cannot fall in love, but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll cut my hair
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
To make you stare
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll hide my chest
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My eyes went dark
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't know where
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Time is
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Slowly
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place72EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 There once was a bittersweet man and they called him, "Lemon Boy"
He was growing in my garden and I pulled him out by his hair like a weed
And like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So, I figured this time I might as well let him be

Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend

But soon his bittersweet started to rub off on me
You’d think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
I found out that my friends are more of the savoury type
And they weren’t too keen on compromising with a nice lemon pie

So Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along together
I'll help him plant his seeds and we'll mow the lawn in bad weather
It’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So, I got myself a citrus friend

But what if I run out of fertilizer
What if the clouds run out of rain
What if Lemon Boy won’t grow no longer
What if beaches dry of sugarcane
Oh well
The whales start to beach themselves
The tortoise shells tear away from their spines
It happens all the time, it happens all the time
Lemon Boy and I, we’re gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we’ll get around wherever

Lemon Boy and I, we’re gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we’ll get around wherever
It’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him

'Cause we're the bitterest boys in town
Yeah, we’re the bitterest guys around
And I got myself a citrus friend52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I'm a dumb teen boy
I eat sticks and rocks and mud
I don't care about the government
And I really need a hug
I feel stupid (stupid!)
Ugly (ugly!)
Pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong but
I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world?
I bet it's just so much better

I just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

Don't mess with me, I’m a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how its s’posed to be? Though it isn’t me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Boys will be bugs, right?
I'm a dumb teen boy
All I wanna do is quit
My mum told me that she's worried
And I couldn't give a shit
I have friends who understand me
Their names are spider, beetle, bee
They don’t say much but
They have always listened to me

The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they’re lying all the time
The bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it

I just turned fourteen
And I think I know everything

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s’posed to be? Though it isn’t me
Boys will be bugs, right?

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary

 Life's alright in Devil Town
They're right, no one's gonna catch us now
Dad has bought a new car now
We're fine, no one's gonna catch us now

You said something dumb again
She's mad, at least that's what they say
Mum and Daddy aren't in love
That's fine, I'll settle for two birthdays

Devil Town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too

We're all dead in Devil Town
That's fine, 'cause nothing's gonna scare us now
We're all in our dressing gowns, mine's white
And stripey, yours is green and brown
I forgot my name again
I think that's something worth remembering
Spiders in your favourite shoes
Just leave them because they're more scared of you

Devil town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too

 You don't have to be a hero to save the world
It doesn't make you a narcissist to love yourself
It feels like nothing is easy; it'll never be
That's alright, let it out, talk to me

You don't have to be a prodigy to be unique
You don't have to know what to say or what to think
You don't have to be anybody you can never be
That's alright, let it out, talk to me

Anxiety, tossing, turning in your sleep
Even if you run away, you still see them in your dreams
It's so dark tonight, but you'll survive, certainly
It's alright, come inside, and talk to me

We can talk here on the floor
On the phone, if you prefer
I'll be here until you're okay
Let your words release your pain
You and I will share the weight
Growing stronger day by day
It's so dark outside tonight
Build a fire warm and bright
And the wind it howls and bites
Bite it back with all your might

Anxiety, tossing, turning in your sleep
Even if you run away, you still see them in your dreams
It's so dark tonight, it looks nice, fall asleep
It's alright, come inside, and talk to me36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I need to cry but I can't get anything out of my eyes
Or my head
Did I die?
I need to run but I can't get out of bed for anyone
Not for you, hun

My sour boy is a pain
I wanna shoot him in the brain
But I'd miss him in the morning
It really hurts when I need to so bad but I can't see her
My Juliet, my special girl

But I need to understand
When I can't power through
And when I need some help from you
When I should stand my ground
And when I need to just sit down
Sometimes I act like I know
But I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes
And a bully in his head

I wanna make a colour that no one else has seen before
I wanna be so much more
I hope that she looks at me and thinks “Shit, he's so pretty”
Something I can't believe
But I need to understand
When I can't power through
And when I need some help from you
When I should stand my ground
And when I need to just sit down
Sometimes I act like I know
But I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes
And a bully in his head

Sometimes I act like I know
But I'm really just a kid
With two corks in his eyes

 This is erosion
Grinding up rocks with your molars
A big fish swims past your rod
You can’t catch it, it’s far too fast
Deep hook marks in rubber lips
I see your eyes in the flowers
I’ll pick a bunch for your room
Green and blue to match your pictures

You looked so good in green
I hope you’re well
And you look so good with him
And I’m proud of you still
I miss your perfect teeth
I was too blunt
I hope you feel happy
That’s all I want
That's all I want

Mess in the kitchen
I was so disappointed
I guess I got to my head
And I was too young to understand it
I get it now that it’s too late
I never stopped feeling guilty
I’m over it, I promise that
I just gotta sing it out of me
You looked so good in green
I hope you’re well
And you look so good with him
And I’m proud of you still
Take care of my shirt
Warm and red
I hope you think of me
Still as your friend
I hope you love yourself
Your body and heart
I hope you feel happy

 What’s it like to be alone on a Sunday
Remembering the time you saw them just yesterday?
Sing me a song, tell me your thoughts
I could listen to you all night long
And I don’t care about my sleeping routine
I fucked it up as it is but we’ve got so much time to kill
As the night rocks me to sleep
Remember when we felt like animations
And didn’t need A grades for self-validation?
Tell me about the things that you love
The world simply needs more affection ‘cause
I don’t care about what people think of me
I’m fucked up as it is but we’ve got so much time to kill
And so many things to see
Life’s too short to worry about things that we got wrong
So hug all your friends and let them know
You’re not letting go
No I won’t let go, oh-oh
Oh, oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh-oh oh…
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh

Did you and your friends have fun on the weekend?
Nothin' feels better than sleepin' in, sleepin' in
Watch as my head falls away from the room
I would hug all my friends if they weren’t friends with you
Know what it’s like to be nothing at all
When the night turns cold, my thoughts feel like stone
And it’s nothing I can’t change, but I can’t breathe anymore
I forgot how to walk by myself
I could do with a little more of your help
Life’s too short to worry about things that we got wrong
So hug all your friends and let them know
You’re not letting go

Life’s too short to worry about things that we got wrong

 Feeling sick of myself
Think I'll try to be someone else
Can't be hard to paint a person
In my head create a version
The parallel
Pull my head out the sand
Try as hard as I can
Guess I must be satisfactory
You said you love me exactly the way I am
And you know I find it hard to understand
Pay a visit to the doctor 'cause I have

A sweet tooth for you
I'm wide awake
The sugar went straight to my brain
Feel like a kid, I double tap
My chest with my fist

I like you
Say it back
Say it back

Never had a cavity
Never had nobody as sweet as you
Smooth around the edges, good as new
Gently insulating every rendez-vous
Caught myself blaming planets, like you do
I know every line and curve of your tattoos
A sweet tooth for you
I'm wide awake
The sugar went straight to my brain
Feel like a kid, I double tap
My chest with my fist

I like you
Say it back
Say it back

Sweet tooth for you
My dreamin' space
It's filled with scribbles, tore the page
Decipher them with colored paint
Repair the stitches in my veins
Sweet tooth for you
My honeydew
I'll see you in my garden soon
Beneath the skin, it's cardiac
A safety pin

I like you
Say it back25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I remember the view out the back of the car
Left the front door wide open
Maybe it's a sign that we shouldn't be goin'
I didn't realise it'd be so hard
You and me, sittin' on the trampoline
I think one time we fell asleep
Woke up and felt like it had been weeks
And now it truly has been
(Forgive yourself)
It wasn't meant to be but it's funny how
Life dealt this cheat
To someone who could handle it so well

And while you sleep in the pouring rain
Just know I'll be with you someday
And I'll have a good one 'til then
Just like you told me

I wish we could’ve played that game sometime
I wish we’d talked more online
I’m glad you liked my picture
I stuck it up inside my locker
Becomin' disconnected really puts into perspective
How important every friend is who makes you wanna live
And this time it’s okay to cry
Black sweatpants and pasta with ketchup
When your sister ate the slug it was the grossest thing ever
Collecting beetles in the garden together
You're welcome anytime in my dreams

Muddy hands and climbing trees
Sink-tall while we brush our teeth
Striped shirts and hide and seek
It's all comin' back to me
And while you sleep on a sunny day
Just know I'll remember you always
And no matter how much it hurts
It's not goodbye, just see you later

And while you sleep in the pouring rain
Just know I'll be with you someday
And I'll have a good one 'til then

 I guess it's just another one of those nights
When I'll spend way too much time
On something so small that no one really cares about at all
I guess it's just another one of those thoughts
And I can't really find a cause
Whether it's all just in my mind or something more here in my life

It's you, it's you
Oh god, it's you
It's you
If you're awake then I am too
If you're lost then I'll find you
If you're hurt then I'll fix you
If you go blind I'll describe the view
If you can't feel then I'll hold you
If you fall know I've got you

If you fall down too far and I can't see you through these marks
And your eyes are covered in scars, and my head's filling with tar
Don't worry we'll find another way out

Your silhouette doesn't look quite right
And I can never find the time
To bury my hands in words
I'd grow a new kind of evergreen tree, just for you and me
On second thoughts, will you even remember me?
But it's always been you (It's always been you)
It's always been you (It's always been you)

Feed cucumber sandwich to a pigeon
Chippin' nail varnish on guitar strings
Got a pillow case made out of money
Feelin' pretty fake when I wake up
Tissue paper castle paper caddy
Scaly little friend’s got my backup

Didn’t give me time to say goodbye in the way that I wanted to
So honey close your eyes and stay like you’re supposed to do
Don’t you wanna give me time to write another song for you?

Fuzzy feelin' and I miss you
Why can nothing stay the same?
Fuckin' stupid head, I’m gonna kill you
Melt all your art and drink the paint
I am not a beast, I’m not a monster

You can’t have the bad guys without a hero
And I’m the only one who’s got a cape

But perhaps it’s just my stupid head in the end
Thinkin' "should I wait here or make my way home?"
You said "Go"

Making up problems that don’t exist
Why do I let myself dream like this?
We’re floating away, my body’s in space
We are going home

Missing pieces of my skull
I’ll sew on patches of my own soul
There’s nothing you or I can do so let the stars fall
'Cause from up here the sky is my thoughts
And we’re all so small

Meteor shower
Quick, take cover
But the hues in our hair compliment one another
I’d sell my own bones for sapphire stones
'Cause blue’s your favourite colour
Missing pieces of my skull
I’ll sew on patches of my own soul
There’s nothing you or I can do so let the stars fall
'Cause from up here the sky is my thoughts
And we’re all so small
We're all so...

My heart and the earth share the same rule
It starts with Love and it ends with U
But don’t go outside, it’s dangerous tonight
Without me right here by your side

Figure eight clouds

Clouds lookin' strange
Papercut fingers dancing on the strings
If I could see you right now
I'd dance just for you when the nightlight goes out

Would you dance for me too?
I'm counting on you
The corner shop closes in under an hour
Let's buy too much booze and get drunk in the shower

Thinkin' in figures of eight and it's easy 'cause
I know what it adds up to
Every day is the same but you gave me a brand new set of numbers
Life's in a different colour

Would you dance for me too?

 Cycling down town
Thought the fresh air would pick me up
Up-up and away from the ground
But there’s no talking dog up here
Blowin' up balloons with my dear

Hoped maybe I’d see a familiar face on my way
Passed by some cannabis seeds, it all smells exactly the same
I saw a girl in my dreams but I don’t remember her name
I guess it’s just another one of those days
When I’m missin' everythin'

Carousel round and round
Like a kid’s toy, you wind me up
And I’ve got nothing to say
So you just throw me in the dump truck
Hopin' round the corner I’ll see her

Passed that kid from chemistry who made fun of my name
He didn’t look very happy, I guess we all turn out the same
I saw a girl in my dreams, she kissed me on the face
I guess it’s just another one of those days
When I’m missin' everythin'
When she shows up, she can sit on my shoulders
'Cause I’m so strong, I wish
Piggy-back-ride to the hill, then we roll down
Feelin' like kids for the rest of our lives
Hopin' in the mornin' I’ll meet her

But for now I’ll just be lonely, and my arms will feel so bare
Dreamin' ‘bout her body round me, with my fingers in her hair
It might be so easy, but I am just too scared
'Cause I saw a girl in my dreams, but she doesn’t like me
I saw a girl in my dream...6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I was just born like this
Wish that I could change it
Four peculiar limbs and a head that doesn't fit
Wish that I was still a kid
I was just born like this
Doctors knew before I did
There's another snail living with me in my shell
It's fair to say I don't like it

I'm hanging out with the bullets in my mouth
And when you look away I'll spit them out
I'm hanging out with the foxes and the hounds
And when I fit in I'll break back out

Really hope you've found something
Entertaining
Honestly I've had enough of looking at a dead man

I just wanna scrape my knees
Cry until my mommy sees
Popsicle to make a mess
All over my Sunday best
Learn everything
For the first time again
I just wanna be a kid
I just wanna be a kid
But I don't wanna be a kid who was born like this9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Sharpener's calling me again
Trying to turn it into some
Thing I can draw into my skin
Make it a picture that I love
Instead of something that I wish
I could get in the bath and scrub right off

Why am I ashamed to look the way I do?
All 'cause an escape to me was just a sharpener to you

Big old pill to inch around
There's no copping out this time
Try my best to get it down (Get, get, get, get it down)
Sometimes seems like I'm still young
Looking at the boy across the sink
Thinking, "What the hell have you just done?" ("What the hell have you just done?")

Why am I ashamed to look thе way I do?
All 'cause an escape to mе was just a sharpener to you
Why am I afraid of things I let inside my room?
Just wanted some company, broke the sharpener in two
You say, why am I like this?
You mean, why am I stupid?
'Cause you know you're not trying to fix it
You mean, why am I like this?
You say, why am I selfish?
'Cause you know, honey, you can't help it14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You’re falling further down but I’ve got you by a thread
I wrap the cord around my arms until my hands start to turn red
But it’s not enough, it won’t be enough to save you

She’s so in love with all the things I hate most about myself
I’m so in love with all the sounds she makes when she smiles
And well, it’s a little tough, to put acorn shells on ice sheets
Without breaking through, and flooding the whole town

I hope you’re alright
I didn’t wanna wake up last night
’Cause I quite liked the dream I had of holding your hand
It’s funny how slowly time goes when my thoughts have been racin' all this time

It’s alright to feel a little bit of darkness now and then
I know I’ve said it once but I still tell myself again and again
You’ll never be enough, but what is enough?
You’re selfless
Isn’t that enough?

Banana bread before I go to bed'll put the bees to sleep
Otherwise they’d buzz and sting my lungs all night inside of me
Just wait a little while, you don’t cry too much
You know that when you smile, the sun shines more gently3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 This one’s for my best friend
We never spoke a word
But the way he looked into my eyes
I knew he understood
Grabbin' on so tight
Like nothing matters more
My handsome little scaly guy
My pretty baby boy

And I don’t wanna have to miss you
I don’t wanna have to say goodbye
I don’t wanna have to leave you
To the big bowl in the sky
So lucky that you were mine
Put your PJs on for one last time
And I’m really gonna miss you
Rest easy little guy

Rushin' home from school
Couldn’t stand to be alone
But this year I had someone there
With you I had a home
If I’m friends with everyone
Or have nobody at all
You helped me see that either way
There’s a place where I belong
I don’t wanna have to miss you
I don’t wanna have to say goodbye
I don’t wanna have to leave you
To the big bowl in the sky
Though it’s crushing down on me
We both know it’s what you need
But I’m really gonna miss you
So rest easy buddy
Yeah I’m really gonna miss you
Rest easy for me7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I'll figure out tonight what it is I need to do
Fabricate a lie and relay it back to you
In my head it's only letters
Make it make sense to make it better
Mmm, mmm, mmm

It's a perfect time to put my money in my mouth
Chew it up and spit it directly on the ground
Make some plans I'll never get to
Shake some hands at the venue
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Sittin' in a telescope
Silently with his fingers entwined
He puts his hand to the glass
What's it like outside?
Mmm (What's it like outside?)
Mmm (What's it like outside?)

Through the lens, it's dark, single-digit on the clock
Singing, "Yessiree, I sure like-a you a lot"
All I need is to get her
She'll be happy if you let her
Mmm

Silently with his fingers entwined
He puts his hand to the glass

 She rubs my back for me
On February fourteen
She says that I'll do great
That's not what's scaring me

I get up on my feet
Give her one last hug
They're all waiting for me
I wish that was enough

I got your letter
Hope you feel better
Than I do
I miss you
She said she's here if
I ever need someone to talk to
But all I ever wanna talk about is you

Think I zoned out again
But I still tried my best
They said it's my best show
I hope you were impressed
Just tryin' to buy more time
When as she'd go she'd say
With one regretful smile
"Happy Valentine's Day"
I just stand and stare
Feel my body fallin' away
Feel my body fallin' away

Feel my body fallin' away
I'll see you again someday9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Can you feel that?
Ah, shit
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes, violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

And when I dream...

And when I dream!
No, Mommy, don't do it again!
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, I promise!
No, Mommy, don't hit me!
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me!
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch!
Fuck you! I don't need this shit!
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore!
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die!

Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!

 He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one

Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run!

 The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin

Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation: an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now, my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

I'll have you know that I've become

Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration embedded deep under the skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life
You will be shown how I've become

 Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow beckoning
Then, your fear seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind
And reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer, if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

Don't ignore, listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

If I scare you now, don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see?
Said, if I scare you now, don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see?

Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add onto your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you, completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest, tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering
Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you, completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Return to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, leave me no one
Turn to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, cast aside
Return to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, leave me no one
Turn to me, return to me, return to me
You've made me turn away
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
They take everything from you
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 What has come over me?
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away to fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, bringing a question: Why?

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night
This self-discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away to feast upon (the night)
The source of my felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away, from hibernation
Strong and unafraid, never a question why

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night
Give into the night

In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night

 Tell me exactly what am I supposed to do
Now that I have allowed you to beat me?
Do you think that we could play another game?
Maybe I could win this time
I kind of like the misery you put me through
Darling, you can trust me completely
If you even try to look the other way
I think that I could kill this time

Rah, rah!
Rah, rah!

It doesn't really seem I'm getting through to you
Though I see you weeping so sweetly
I think that you might have to take another taste
A little bit of hell this time

Rah, rah! Lie to me
Rah, rah! Lie to me

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?
You always wanted people to remember you
To leave your little mark on society
Well, don't you know your wish is coming true today?
Another victim dies tonight

Rah, rah! Lie to me
Rah, rah! Lie to me

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?

Is she really
Telling lies again?
Doesn't she realize
She's in danger?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?

And now she will never tell another, a lie

 Listen, everyone
The time will come when all of us say goodbye
Feel that aching in your heart
Leaving you broken inside
But we're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind

So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can

Take the ones you love
And hold them close because there is little time
And don't let it break your heart
I know it feels hopeless sometimes
But they're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind

So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive

So now go do the best things in life
Bring the fight to this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Shine your light on this world while you can

And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive

Artist:Disturbed, 
 I've begun to realize
That I'm better when I am with you
You delivered me from the pain
In my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
Till the day you arrived

Suddenly, I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
And building inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine

Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
Let it haunt me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
Were the one who resurrected
A man who had died
Your power, it gave me new life
Made me reborn and refined
Rebuilt from inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine

I never thought I would ever escape
At times, I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
Thought that I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered, now I
Owe you a debt that I can never repay
I still believe, 'cause you're mine

I'm burning inside
And we both know why
'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine

I can regain control
Because you're mine
I can take over the world
Because you're mine5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

So, what you waiting for?)

I have never compromised
I never gave in
And so, I have welcomed
Every challenge in my life
And I have never wandered blind
I'm led by hunger and so I
Savor every drop
Each minute I'm alive

Leave nothing left behind

Tell me, what you waiting for?

Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded
Don't let them undermine
Your dreams can never be stolen
Don't leave them stagnant
Rotting on the vine
Say goodbye
To anyone who tries
To bleed you dry
You will show them
You're blessed
With an unlimited supply

Leave nothing left behind

 Release me! Rah!

No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely
I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night’s dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
That never went away completely

How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me, ah!

Will I ever know peace of mind again?
I don’t believe it
I can’t achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
It never went away completely
Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die

In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
To let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!

Death’s images are all around again
They’re right behind me
They’re going to find me
Judgment for the immortal sin
That had enveloped me completely, ah!
I know I’ll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they’ll hear me
They don’t fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely

Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die

In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
To let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!
In the end, there will be no suffering (more suffering)
In the end, you will find out everything (not anything)
In the end, you may question your belief (what belief?)
In the end, you will realize, finally, how you were deceived
This has gone on too long (too long)
No more demonic dreams
Destroyer, come tonight
Because her memory is killing me

In asylum
(I live a lie)
I let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
For asylum
(Relive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time (without you)
This world is not fulfilling me, ah!

Don’t think I live in asylum, I live a lie
Don’t want to live in asylum, I’ll live a lie

 Once again we hear them calling for war
It doesn't matter what they're fighting for
They light the match and watch the whole world burst into flame
The story's always the same
So tell me, people, are you ready to kill?
Behold the propaganda, get your fill
A distant enemy is threatening our freedom again
How much would you like to spend?

Millions are falling in line
And it's just a matter of time
Endless destruction will ensure their pockets are lined
For all time

No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

They don't care about the blood on their hands
Look at the world, and you will understand
They count the money as the innocent continue to bleed
They're always planting the seed
So tell me, people, are you ready to die
Without believing in the reason why?
They paint a picture, and the whole damn world is deceived
It's all that they ever need
Millions keep falling in line
It's only a matter of time
Sowing destruction will make sure their pockets are lined
For all time

No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore

No, it can't be disguised anymore
How they smile as we pay for their war

No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore

A land of darkness from which I cannot return
You're aching, so will I

I've been damaged by your

World, dishonored by your world
Your world, I'm haunted by your world

Never will I be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters
You surround yourself with
Feeding of the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal breed of subhuman parasites
Thrown into a feeding frenzy
With the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see
The creatures for what they are:
A swirling mass of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough
To think you are unaffected
The conversion has already begun
You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching our movements
And filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so will I
When I awake to discover
How I've been ravaged by your

Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There, burning into the night

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go ‘round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion?

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them, and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time

So, we look for the future
But there's not much love to go ‘round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

Ooh, when the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright
All through the night
In the wake of this madness
As I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
Too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go ‘round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion?

Now, this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given

To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing

Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head I sang

Keep you in the dark and so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

 Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Kudos, my hero
Leaving all the mess
You know my hero
The one that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero

Artist:Foo Fighters, 
 I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose

My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Artist:Foo Fighters, 
 All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothing to hide
On and on, I got nothing to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Then I'm done, done, on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next—
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next—

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste

 Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

I think I'm done nursing the patience
It can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright

Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

 What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

Temper
Temper
Temper
One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit
Into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free

Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)

 A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Gettin' good at startin' over
Every time that I return

I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn?
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growin' stronger?
Little conquerors

I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to die, I never want to die
I'm on my knees, I never want to die
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to leave, I never say goodbye
Forever, whenever, forever, whenever

I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?

Arrows in her eyes, tears in her arteries
War in her mind, shame as she cries

I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singing along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now, here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now, here I go, well

Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You had no choice you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something

But I've been here before, after all
The witching hour is upon us
You and I can sing haunted songs
In my dreams, I'm climbing ladders
And then I tumble down, rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing, on and on, on and on

I feel an earthquake coming on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

You're my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun, row by row

I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Dirty water in my blood (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Heavy metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Artist:Foo Fighters, 
 Ain't that the way it always starts
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you station to station
Hey, don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothin' more to say
Come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down
Button up, don't make a sound, shame, shame, go away
Come again some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up

You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop

Chase all of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you
Wait, I wanna see if you can shake
I want to keep all I can take
I feel much better now, use me up, spit me out
Let me be your hand-me-down, fame, fame, go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up

You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop

My sweet Virginia, I'm the same as I was in your arms
My sweet Virginia, I'm the same as I was in your heart

Shame, shame go away, come again some other day
Memories keep haunting me, help me chase them all away
Hush, now settle down, button-up, don't make a sound
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground
Come now, take the blame, that's okay, I'll play the game
I don't care, it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria

 One, two, three, four

I know what you're thinking
We were going down
I can feel the sinking
But then I came around

And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothing mattered anymore
I looked into the sky

Well I wanted something better man
I wished for something new
And I wanted something beautiful
And wish for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
Know your head is spinning
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Coming to an end

Well you wanted something better man
You wished for something new
Well you wanted something beautiful
You wished for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over

 I've been waiting on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
Never really wanted to be number one
Just wanted to love everyone

Is there more to this than that?

Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this
More to this, more to this than

Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Every day waiting for the sky to fall
Big crash on a world that's so small
Just a boy with nowhere left to go
Fell in love with a voice on the radio

Is there more to this than that?

 You say I take it for granted
I say you've taken it all
Say you can take it or leave it
You got your head in the ceiling
When are you gonna come down?
When you're that high, can you feel it?

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

You wanna tell me a secret
You think I'm gonna find out
You tell the lie, you should keep it
Don't wanna know where it's leading
Don't want to follow you 'round
My first mistake was believing

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away? (Do you give it away?)
Do you let go? (Do you let go?)
Where do you find it? Oh

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain

If it gets much better, it's going to get worse

 I never walk about after dark
It's my point of view
'Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you
Always coming and you'd never have a clue
And now I look behind all the time
I will wait forever
Always looking straight
Thinking, counting all the hours you wait

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night

And no, I'm not a jerk
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
I know it's good to be tough like me
But I would wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me
"Girl, you know you've got to watch your health"
To look into my eyes and tell me
La la la la la
To look into my eyes and tell me

Going out as I close our window
You never liked me anyway

Aye yeah, aye yeah
Aye, I don't see the light I saw in you before

It's nice that you say you like me
But only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect glow
It got lost when you gave it up though
Cause you want money, you want fame

Lately, I just turn 'em into demons
Flew into the sun, fucking heroin
Lately, I just turn 'em into reasons and excuses

Always down when I'm not up, guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent blue
But I can't see above it, guess I fucking love it
But, oh, I didn't mean to

I see everything, I see everything
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it
But I did everything, I did everything
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet (Woo)

Funny how they think us naive when we're on the brink
Innocence was fleeting like a season
Cannot comprehend, lost so many men
Lately, all their ghosts turn into reasons and excuses

It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
Run away, get caught
Put in cell, livestock
Calculate, old body

 This, this music makes me cry
It sounds just like my soul
Oh, I'm not ready to win
Oh Lord, cause I don't wanna know what they say
Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain

The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in...

California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad

Oh (ah-ah-ah)
Come Monday, it's a dream (ah-ah-ah)
Broken my own heart again
Chasing something beautiful
Oh Lord, but I don't understand what they say

藏在肺裡的尖叫
藏在骨頭和肌肉裡的
沒有爆破前 毋庸置疑的
都會揪緊成病
曾經 乾燥的 都被潑濕
膨脹後彈牙 多肉 黏膩多汁
一個女人徒手拔掉滿頭黑髮
在夢境的山稜線行走
思念聚集成蚊蟲
張開沒有焦點的瞳孔
就像….快 張開沒有欲望的大腿
我咬下去 你還是無動於衷嗎
明明可以叫出來的呀
沿著你的脊椎走
我的手指 戳出一個冰涼的湖
四處張望 無人看守
暴露狂脫掉風衣 淚流滿面地 跳進去

計劃把你高潮的尖叫聲錄起 來
卻發現剛剛按錯了鍵
一去不復返 無能重複那時刻
你躺著
和逐漸冰冷的液體 撕扯著
黏膩 透明 在我的手心開出具有彈性的花
我覺得不夠 想從你身體裡擠出更多
就在這個時候電話響起
窗外的鹿群 飛奔離去 同時
急遽消退 藍色的風 抹去世界邊緣的泡沫
從你半開的雙眼繞過
接起電話 靜默降臨
剛醒來的情慾 在電話裡喘氣 尖叫
我邊聽 邊把你的汗一滴滴舔掉
不能吼出來 那就吞下去

English Translation
The screams that are buried in the lungs
Buried in the bones and the muscles
Unexploded, undeniable
Cram into a sickness
What used to be dry is now sodden
Swollen, meaty, moist and juicy
My teeth are bouncing off it
A woman pulls out the headful of black hair with her bare hands
Walks along the mountain ridges in a dream
Remembrance swarms like mosquitos
Opening up the unfocused eyes
As if… Quick, spread the legs without desire wide
I take a bite, are you still unmoved
You can scream out
Tracing along your spine
My fingers created a cold lake
I look around, no one is guarding
The exhibitionist takes out his coat
And jumps into it with tears on his face
I planned to record your scream as you reached orgasm
But then realize that I’ve pressed the wrong button
The moment has been lost, irretrievable
You lie there
Struggling with the body fluid that is getting cold
Sticky, transparent, elastic flowers in my palm
I’m not satisfied; I want to squeeze more out of your body
The telephone rings at this moment
A herd of deer run past the window and at the same time
Blue winds are dispelled so quickly, wiping out the foams on the margin of the world
Escaping from your half-opened eyes
Picking up the phone, silence comes
The desire just awoken breathes and screams in the receiver
As I listen I lick away every drop of your sweat

If you can’t scream then swallow it down12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I got a big dream, small world in between
Me and everything I can't do
Not really that great, just okay and kinda fake
You sucked the life right out of the room

I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Don't be unkind
You're so far behind me

But I can't see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, who made a mistake?
Don't you cry

It's mine
It's mine

I saw the parade, big band, masquerade
So what brings you now to my feet?
Back at the first page, nothing gained for you but age
Oh, nothing else could be more complete
I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Call me unkind
You're so far behind me

But I can't see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, who made a mistake?
Don't you cry

It's mine
It's mine
Dim the light
In your head, in your heart, in your hiding emotion
Where the waters meet?

 So, we party when the sun goes low
Imminent annihilation sounds so dope
I'm not shy but I refuse to speak
Because I don't trust you to understand me

You know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark

(I hear they're calling my name)
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
(I hear they're calling my name)
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah
I don't need to sleep anymore
That's what the drugs are for

Every city has a place like this
Underneath the bridges where the tainted kiss
Put on "Bullet with Butterfly Wings"
So that I can sing along while I break things
You know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark
Ooh, you know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark

(I hear they're calling my name)

The a-a-angel of death, right behind me
Paradise on my right, and h-h-hell on my left
The a-a-angel of death, right behind me
Paradise on my right, h-h-h-hell on my left
And the angel of death, she said to God
"Un-fuck the world, un-fuck the world
You stupid girl, you stupid girl"

Oh, oh

The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore

 Dirt in your fingernails
Blood on your knees
But did that ever make you happy?
I think you were my best friend
Gentle do not reprehend
I know it hasn't been a dream
But if you pardon, I will mend
Drunk in a parking lot
Just after three
Tearin' out your hair like a banshee
Lighter and a safety pin
Light the end, burn the skin
I'll stick to you forever
Cause this scar I think is permanent

Oh
Falling off the edge with you
Oh
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true

Bite off your fingernails
Cut up your skin
Tell me that it didn't happen
Running  through the dark woods
Fallen couldn't see straight
I was only looking for a human to reciprocate
Baby it's a black hole
I need it to breathe
But does it really make you happy?
Kiss me with a big knife
Bloody heart of paradise
Living like a soldier
Peace of mind must be nice

Oh falling off the edge with you
Oh it was too good to be true
Too good to be true

Thought I had won
I thought I won til I lost
And I, fixing my fall
But for what cost?
And I see your reflection when I look at mine
And I say (I say, I say)
Baby, don't go away
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Got to Heaven anyway
Think I might regret it now
Tie my feet to rocks and drown

If you don't bleed, then you don't die
Cross my heart and hope to fly
If you like it, then you'll make it out alive
If they could see me now, smiling six feet underground
I'll tie my feet to rocks and drown
You'll miss me when I'm not around

Last call, last call

Promise if I make it, I'll kiss you good night

This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

 Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day
By two, drawing pictures
Of innocent times
Can you add colour
Inside these lines?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

Sure, if we change our perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me

Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

Artist:In Flames, 
 From here, I can hardly see a thing
We're further off with every passing second
I will follow anyone that brings me to you
But the sense of time is catching up with me

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?
If I act like I'm untouchable and golden?

Wonder when I'll hit the ground
Been to space, but I am falling
Wasting what is mine
For a voice that's calling

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

I am done with watching graves grow mould
The sins are mine, I believe them to be
All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, I'm on my knees
Feel like you've forgotten me

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

How could you leave me behind?
I'm tired, and I felt it for some time
I can't take this much longer
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral


All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, give me a sign
Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am, in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:In Flames, 
 It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And meet a fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

The water drops just beg to hit me
Why now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide and seek
I call upon you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me feeling
These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me feeling

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be

Artist:In Flames, 
 I got a new kind of fear, something you don't wanna view
There's this path that I can see, it leads straight to misery
We can't undo what we have done, just face what's up ahead
We fight and we stumble, the fuse is lit, you better run now

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, the outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

What if I say to you: "Let's leave this earth for a while"
A perspective from the hollow and the wheel we can't control

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, we'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space

When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back

 Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you
I need to find something to blame for a long lost time

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can you please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today there are only a few
The sign of times my friend
Avoid infinity?
Are you for real?

(Just scratch the surface, and you will find)

 Don't ever let them use you
They will bring you to your knees
I'll try to lead you for a while
But every time I talk to you, you're too afraid to see

Artist:In Flames, 
 People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear the next one!

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill, or should I be left behind?
Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail?
With all that is given
You crossed the line
You remembered my name
Time runs backwards
And we're heading that way

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
Oh, when least expected; cloud connected

 I like to look at you from a distance
I like when you scream in my face
Afraid to say the right words in right order
So they makes sense to a person with such grace

What if my dreams don't become reality?
Is my life just a big mistake?
Will I be happy for the times I had?
Or would I reconsider and recalculate?

I wanna be heard, but leave no trace
I wanna be seen, but take no space
I wanna be, I wanna be, leave no trace
I wanna be, I wanna be, take no space

The older I get, the younger I feel
The younger I feel, the older I seem
The more I feel, my age seems real
I like to pretend I'm as young as I feel

I wanna be heard, but leave no trace
I wanna be seen, but take no space
I wanna be, I wanna be, leave no trace
I wanna be, I wanna be, take no space
Leave no trace
Take no space

 The serpent knows
When the curtain falls
In denial's blindfold
It greets another day

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

I found secrets about life's undertow

Life's wrapped in a riddle
Easier said than done
Hate to play the victim
Let's run and hide
Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

I found secret's about life's undertow
Let them take me far away

Crawl back in place
It's easier to go behind the curtain
Wipe the worries away
No thought about a consequence

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in
Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

Artist:In Flames, 
 Your self control makes me feel alone
I've tried confidence, had it for breakfast today
I've lost the perfection, a mess without words
As the seasons change I'll continue to ignore
The image I project is me without me
The picture that I scanned is borrowed
After the education you stopped making sense to me
Seems to me that it's all the same
Time and time and time and time again
Slowly, what I believed in, turning into a lie
To aim and miss, my supernatural art
Spending too much time with myself
Trying to explain who I am

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay
I need someone to break the silence
Before it all falls apart
I need something to cling onto
Before I break you in parts
So afraid of what you may think
And all the plastic people that surrounds me
I have to find the path to where it all begins
To teach the world my supernatural art

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:In Flames, 
 As I aim for that bright white day
Conflict serum with my aura
It seems that life's so fragile
I guess I'll fly some other time
I lack from superhighway thoughts
Won't live as long as the city lights
Soaked by underwater times
Electric splash on a midnight drive

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Sometimes I don't belong
Release me from your world
Pacified by the small things in life
I wait for earthquakes to rearrange
Never been able to use the force
I've only have it read to me
Despite all the misguided faith
I'll find a place in this mess

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Early morning moments
A glimpse of joy
But soon it's over and I return to dust
As I try to be
Everything and everyone
I shrivel up and waste away
Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

 Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure
Tell me which side I'm on (who is friend or foe)
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying
(Slowly)

In many ways, I'm the burden
That divides us from the light
In many ways, you're the halo
That keeps my spirit alive

Temptation
Play the good or evil part
With me, you evoke the dark
Erase, my free will, and, watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep, balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying

Bemused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive, will I fly from here?
But as the chosen pessimist
I, I carve my name in stone
I, I carve my name in stone
Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive, I fly from here

How can I keep balance in this race?

I became the blade, and I pierced through
Now hiding from the world outside
Trying to create magic for the pacified

When the sky is clear, we will remember
Through thick and thin, we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear, we will remember

Calling our gathered masses from the colony to the hive
Come to realize not an ordinary story
We are on a highway, nothing left to lose

Set yourself on fire as we remember this forever
We remember this forever
When the sky is clear, we will remember
Through thick and thin, we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear, we will remember


When the sky is clear, we will remember
(When the sky is clear, we will remember)
Through thick and thin, we won't surrender
(Through thick and thin, we won't surrender)
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear, we will remember
When the sky is clear, we will remember

 In your world, the day is no threat
In my world, there is an absence of light
"Genetic superior cell"
Controlled by the fathomless and unbearable

A radical new form of plastic and rage
Biologically optimized
But with a strangling pulse

In your world, you find me worthy
In my world, I "parashoot" my life
A virtual drugstore
Populated by the fathomless and unbearable

Machine, meat and blood
In an intimate relationship
The new - superior -
More effective than all the preceeding

When we can no longer cry
And reality is torn
Then it's easy to forget
That the responsibility lies on us all
When we can no longer cry
And reality is torn
Then it's easy to forget
That the responsibility lies on us all

In your world, the night is no threat
In my world, the darkness transforms
To a vision of hell
Populated by fathomless and unbearableEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster, breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Planets devastated, mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel
Evil's going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Oh!

Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected, forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Ah!


He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
He is the Painkiller

 There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of "do or die"
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go? You're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

That's right, here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks

If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go? You're mad
You got another thing comin'

In this world we're livin' in, we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in, aim for a new tomorrow

 Up here in space, I’m looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you’ve private lives, think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape, I’m watching all the time

I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

Always in focus, you can’t feel my stare
I zoom into you, but you don’t know I’m there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye


Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There’s nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows

 He had enough, he couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried, they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand

Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there, stare blank into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled, it seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye, and then he died

Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But I shall win

How many like him are there still?
But to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost?

Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

 Whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane?
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find no new connection

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to get some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough, I've had enough, good God, pluck me

Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine, she was mine
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore

Artist:Judas Priest, 
 Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go

We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind

We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air

He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free

We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try

 Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

 You won't hear me, but you'll feel me
Without warning, something's dawning, listen
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats when you run for cover
You can't retreat, I spy like no other
Then we'll race together
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

We hold each other closer
As we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by
With every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though
We've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony
We hear the engines cry
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover


On and on we're charging
To the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity
Of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven
In this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment
We shatter and explode

 I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make


You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike

 Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of Hell

Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Beware the beast in black

You know he's coming back

As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
Come to me it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Beware the beast in black

Bring in the foe to be defeated

Come rally round this lack of freedom

Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives on danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser red lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight

No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace

I can't get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heartbeat
And the voice in the dark of some kind

Oh, I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Out in the cold

Escaping from the world we're in

And I know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
Angel won't you set me free

Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun

When I close my eyes, I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see
Angel shine your light on me

Angel we'll meet once more, I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh, angel take me far away

 Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing out a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always taking, baby, but that's okay
What they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once, you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

 Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker

Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load

 I made a spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, fire island
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes

I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled "Give me a bourbon"
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that

I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours


Sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures, not colours
The true free expression I demand is human rights, right
I gave my life, I am immortal
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss

 You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack

I smile when I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all

All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the Ripper

You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if I'm near
I'm sly and I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for "the Ripper"
Or if you like "Jack the Knife"

Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream at the sight

All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the Ripper

Artist:Judas Priest, 
 I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Now I see you standing all around
And snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes on white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could've died then and there
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Judas Priest, 
 Along deserted avenues, steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready, prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line

Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel

Dogs whine in the alleys, smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell, a cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow

Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars, the challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars with which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest the rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests have finished many lives


Now facing one another, the standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls as the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers with shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless, impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death he's sown

Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream

All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing


Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

 Man-eating momma, steam-driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messing, all-in wrestling
Is one of her pride and joys
She's a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two-faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine

You can take her if you want her

 Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feelin' like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

 Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
Throw it down

Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!

Twisting me!
They won't go away!
So I pray!
Go away!
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me

 Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Another place I find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Deeper, and deeper, and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner...
Self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (going blind)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind!

 I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in…

I can't hear this (scat singing)
I can't fuck it (scat singing)
I can't take this (scat singing)
I hate (scat singing)

 Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kick off the front floor
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never ever follow
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, someway, each day
Dealing with no forgiveness
Why, this shit inside, now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel and now this shit will follow

God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something they took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!

Waiting for your little peanut

Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (Over here)
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako

Your mother had your brother (Nuh-uh)

Pity me in the end

Does not protect me

I'm gonna knock this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down
And there's a catch with this waiting
All of my thoughts are overtaking
Do I got the strength to take this fucker down? (Down, down, down)

Deep in me, insulting
Talking shit, pushing me
Cold
Cold
Inside lying deep, the father of hate
The endless nightmare I can never escape
The broken in flames, they call out my name
They dance in my dreams while I scream out in pain

I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down

Alone, awake with the craving
I watch my step, I'm calculating
On how I'm taking this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down
I don't know what I am thinking
Sometimes I feel like I am sinking
Into the ground I'll call my grave

Cold
Inside lying deep, the father of hate
The endless nightmare I can never escape

I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down
Break it down
Deep in me, insulting
Talking shit, pushing me

I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down
I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down

They come for me, discomforting
They make me feel like I'm one step away

From doing it, I'm through with it
I can't do it, suffer, can't get to it

All right go
Four I just said (Four) you faggot piece of shit on the ground

Hey, are you saying so there's no clicks?

I get "Twist," I wish we could put "Twist" on the fucking tape
Want to hear it?
Stupid
Fuck you!

Okay

Anger inside builds within my body
Why'd you hit me?
What have I done?
You tried to hit me!
Swing at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you're harder than me
What's with you boy, think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared, to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man!

I don't run around
Trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free
You're just a wannabe!

Swing at me again, if you like
Throw your hate at me, with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you're harder than me
What's with you boy, think hard

 This time, I'm taking it away
I've got a problem
With me getting in the way
Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain!

This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
Oh, I cannot give any more

My mind's done with this, okay?
I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein
Vein, vein
This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)

 Life

Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
In the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way

Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life
That's not right out insane

Satisfaction is delayed
Its motivation is displayed
Flaunting its misogyny
Funny how I thought it'd go away
Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life
That's not right out insane

I'm constantly beat up inside
And I'm the one to blame
No one can relate to me

 Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

Humiliating, I fall to its craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me

 I dream of a past so I can break through
The walls I have built inside
The thoughts I can grasp, transparency through
They constantly fight and collide

I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me

Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)

Why can't I relax and let it be true?
This world that I tried to hide
It's kind of a mess, too reckless for you
This place makes me feel alive

I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me
Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)

The call for the purposes, the changing behavior
Ends at us all, we keep constraints on the strangers
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective
Then you know it, you feel it
It's as dark as you can get you want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, you might just want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, I don't think you'll ever get it

Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I don't know, I just feel the craving
I see the flesh, and it smells fresh
And it's just there for the taking
These little girls
They make me feel so goddamn exhilarated
I fill them up, I can't give it up
The pain that I'm just erasing

I tell my lies, and I despise
Every second I'm with you
So I run away, and you still stay
So what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them!
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same!
My heart inside is constantly hating!
I'm sorry, I just throw you away!

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold
I don't know why it hurts me
All I wanna do is get with you
And make the pain go away
Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me
Why do I have this torment?
All I wanna do is fuck it away
I tell my lies, and I despise
Every second I'm with you
So I run away, and you still stay

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad

Just to get some sort of attention, attention

 As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?

And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

Happiness is found
In darkest ways
And as I search around
I knew nothing but mistakes
And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down

So why did the path have to lead this way?

You push me so much further ahead
And when I leave

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

 She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within

Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure

Give it

Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore

He put the gun into his face
Bang!

Problems do have solutions, you know
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash
Everything's blue
Everything's blue in this world
The deepest shade of mushroom blue
All fuzzy

Crawl right up on your knees
Please, greed, feed

I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

Shove it up, inside, surprise!
Lies, stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it

 You had all of them on your side
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left
In my fucking world is wearing your disease

How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so hard?
How'd it get so long?

You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you?  Didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
And what you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are

You didn't hurt me

 This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me, I hate everyone

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
I want to but I can't turn back

 I beat my machine
It's a part of me, it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me, I am becoming
The me that you know
He had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs
He is broken and sore
The me that you know
He doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore

All pain disappears
It's the nature of of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear
No escape from this, my new consciousness
The me that you know
He used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping
And he is left to decay
The me that you know
Is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you
I'm so far away
I can try to get away
But I’ve strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away
The sound in my ears
I can see it killing away
All of my bad parts
I don't want to listen
But it's all too clear
Hiding backwards inside of me
I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter
I might just slip away

It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head

 He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity
He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity

God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there

He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion atrocities done in his name

God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
Your God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there

Burning with your god in humility
Will you die for this?
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there

 Focus?
We didn't even notice
We awake in a place
We can barely recognize
Yeah, hypnosis

And you can justify it all
Your back was up against the wall again

Shut up, silence
Add a little violence
And offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

So, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Go and look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong with you?

Too many fucking people
You'll have to take care of yourselves

 I'm losing ground
Well you know how this world can beat you down
And I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way

I'm always falling down the same hill
Bamboo puncturing this skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place

I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
Don't tell me that you care
There really isn't anything, now, is there?
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste
Like that means something
And oh so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help

 I've become impossible
Holding on to when
When everything seemed to matter more
The two of us (all used)
All used and beaten up
Watching fate
As it flows
Down the path
We have chose

You and me
We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow
You and me
If the world should break in two
Until the very end of me
Until the very end of you

Awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin
They pick and they pull
Trying to get their fingers in
Well, they've got to kill what we found
Well, they've got to hate what they fear
Well, they've got to make it go away
Well, they've got to make it disappear
The farther I fall I'm beside you
As lost as I get I will find you
The deeper the wound I'm inside you
For ever and ever I am a part of
You and me
We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow
You and me
If the world should break in two
Until the very end of me
Until the very end of you

All that we were is gone we have to hold on
All that we were is gone we have to hold on
When all our hope is gone we have to hold on
All that we were is gone but we can hold on

You and me
We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow

 She shines in a world full of ugliness
She matters when everything is meaningless
Fragile, she doesn't see her beauty
She tries to get away
Sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving
I can't watch her slip away

I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart

She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
Hoping someone can see
If I could fix myself I'd--
But it's too late for me

I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart

Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore

I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
Come on, tell me!

 You're keeping in step
In the line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
Cause you do
What you're told
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you want to change it?

What if this whole crusade's
A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
Which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?
So naïve
I keep holding on to what I want to believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on

Will you stay down on your knees?

Sometimes, yet I still pretend
I can't remember how this got started, oh
But I can tell you exactly how it will end

Every day is exactly the same

There is no love here and there is no pain

I am still inside
A little bit comes bleeding through

But I just don't know, I don't know

In the back, off the side, and far away
Is a place where I hide, where I stay
Tried to say, tried to ask, I needed to
All alone by myself, where were you?
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now
Just like you would always say, we'll make it through
Then my head fell apart and where were you?
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Everything you swore would never change is different now
Like you said, you and me make it through
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you?20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Honestly I’m waiting for you to say you’re ready
If this is happening, just tell me
No hesitation, no stopping
It just feels right
But why am I like this?

Take your time, wrong or right
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Yes or no? Don’t go slow
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Our own bloody Sunday
Our own bloody Sunday

So irrational this feeling
Getting physical, I’m ready
Seducing me with temptation
Feeling free, your motivation
It just feels right
(If this is happening, just tell me)
But why am I like this?

Take your time, wrong or right
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Yes or no? Don’t go slow
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Our own bloody Sunday
Our own bloody Sunday
Our own bloody Sunday
Our own bloody Sunday
They say we’re out of control
They say they that we just don’t know
And maybe we’ll prove them right
But not tonight

Take your time, wrong or right
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Yes or no? Don’t go slow
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Our own bloody Sunday
Our own bloody Sunday
Take your time, wrong or right
I just wanna feel alive tonight
Yes or no? Don’t go slow
I just wanna feel alive tonight

 Don't listen to my head, don't listen to my friends
Keep hoping things get better
Don't listen when we fight, don't care when you cry
Keep hoping things get better

Don't blame me, I'm not the same me
Lost sight of what I want
Don't blame me, I'm not the same me (same me)

If we're not miserable then show me misery
Cause our hearts don't agree and this is killing me

We used to make love, it was all okay (all okay)
Now we just fuck to hide the pain
What was innocence has turned to shame

Don't blame me, I'm not the same me
Lost sight of what I want
Don't blame me, I'm not the same me (same me)

If we're not miserable then show me misery
Cause our hearts don't agree and this is killing me
I don't believe in anything
You want what's worst for me

I'm not the same me, I'm not the same me
I'm not the same me, I'm not the same me

 Will you listen to what I said?
Do you believe that I’m worth it?
I can’t fall asleep
I can’t live with my dreams

It’s hard to know myself
Trapped in my own head
I’m trapped, I’m trapped
Trapped in my head

You’re running from everything
That’s seeping from the depths of me
You’re begging for anything
That’s a life I’ll never see
I’ll keep searching, I’m angry!
I’ve been haunted by my dreams!

 The drive to be someone you’re not
Chased desert dreams in hopes I’m not forgotten
I told myself that I was doing the right thing
Faked everything, faked everything I’m not
Red clouds come down
Won’t you take me away?
Red clouds all around
Won’t you take me away?
I remember how badly I wanted to be here
Now I’m just scared
Unveiled destiny
Miles apart from me
I told myself that I was doing the right thing
Faked everything, faked everything I’m not
Red clouds come down
Won’t you take me away?
Red clouds all around
Won’t you take me away?
Cause sometimes it takes a little bit of leaving
To find to find some meaning
Red clouds come down
Won’t you take me away
Won’t you take me away
My intention to be better than you thought I could be
Ended up getting caught up in the life I never thought I ever would be
They say they “told me so”
But how could I have ever known
Well now I know better
I’ll never be your prisoner
I hoped you knew me better
I am my own prisoner
Red clouds come down
Won’t you take me away?
Red clouds all around
Won’t you take me away?
Cause sometimes it takes a little bit of leaving
To find to find some meaning

Won’t you take me away

 Does anybody even care?
Is anybody listening to me?
I'm lying here invisible
Feeling all your empty stares through me

I'm begging for a better way
Don't know how much more of this I can take
'Cause anger's so much easier
Than fixing everything I can't face

I'm stuck inside the madness, I know you've felt this
But I know we'll make it out somehow
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope
Inside the sadness, sometimes it traps us
And we think we're better off alone
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope

I feel it every time I breathe
Another cure that doesn't work for me
Darkness and anxiety
Seem to be the only friends I see
I'm praying for a better day
But reality takes its place
And will I ever be enough?
Will I ever be enough for me?

I'm stuck inside the madness, I know you've felt this
But I know we'll make it out somehow
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope
Inside the sadness, sometimes it traps us
And we think we're better off alone
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope

I know you're gonna take a shot at my heart
What you didn't know is I can see in the dark
I learned to adapt to the world that I see
I learned not to trust anybody but me
But me
I know you're gonna take a shot at my heart
But what you didn't know is I can see in the dark
I learned to adapt to the world that I see
Learned not to trust anybody but me
I'm stuck inside, I'm stuck inside
I'm stuck inside the madness, I know you've felt this
But I know we'll make it out somehow
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope
Inside the sadness, sometimes it traps us
And we think we're better off alone
It's like a war from within just to let go

 Stuck in a bottle, think I need that
Tears in my eyes, can't go back
Tunnel vision, now all hope is missin'
Thinking that I made the right decision
Then two turned to four, now I've lost track
Memories flooded as it goes black
Mistakes that I've made just attack, attack
When you're this lost, most don't come back

Too close with no chance to let you know

So tell me was it worth it?
Even if you're hurting?
I'd given in to all my darkest doubts
Like there was no way out
Tell me was it worth it?
Maybe I deserve this?
I'd given in to all my darkest doubts
Like there was no way out

Tell my family I love them, I'm sorry
Tell my friends it's okay if they hate me
Tried so hard, came up empty
Forgive and forget isn't like me
I never learned how I need to let go
It's all too much so I swallowed the pain away
I couldn't stay
Too close with no chance to let you know

So tell me was it worth it? (Worth it)
Even if you're hurting? (Deserve this)
I'd given in to all my darkest doubts
Like there was no way out
Tell me was it worth it? (Worth it)
Maybe I deserve this? (Deserve this)
I'd given in to all my darkest doubts
Like there was no way out

I ran away, I ran away
Lied to myself, said it was okay
I hid the pain thinking it'd go away
Couldn't escape, I found another way
I ran away, I ran away
Trying to feel something
(Ooh-ooh)
(Oh-oh)

So tell me was it worth it?
Even if you're hurting?
I'd given in to all my darkest doubts
Like there was no way out
So tell me was it worth it? (Worth it)

 Let me tell you what makes me me
Forgiving friends and family
I know I don't deserve them
But here I am
Living a lie, I was out of reach
Forgot the son you raised me to be
I know I don't deserve you
But here I am

I'm blessed, I'm cursed
Thoughts in my head making it worse
I always make things worse

I'm lost and found
In the safety in all of my doubts
I'm lost and found
I'm human

I know you think that you know me
But I've only told you part of my story
So here it goes
I thought that I was invincible
Caught up in the wrong crowd, a criminal
But here I am
I'm blessed, I'm cursed
Thoughts in my head making it worse
I always make things worse

I'm lost and found
In the safety in all of my doubts
I'm lost and found
I'm human
At the end of the day I'm always gonna find a way
No matter what people say
I'm human
I don't live with regrets even when I'm a mess
I can never forget
I'm human

I epitomize what most people been disguising
I was gone like starships that started my enterprises
Wasn't nothing funny, I was bummy like the bunny
But I energize it
I was so indecisive, you can't describe it
You couldn't get the drugs I'm on, oh no you can't prescribe it
Found the Word Alive Matty plugged me they amplified it
This is just my journey and my story I can't rewrite it
The world been divided, I'm sent here to unify it
This is true unbiased
And my crew the highest
Why you got your head low?
You should keep it higher
I am true unbiased
And my crew the highest
Why you got your head low?
You should keep it higher
I'm blessed, I'm cursed
Thoughts in my head making it worse
I always make things worse

I'm lost and found
In the safety in all of my doubts
I'm lost and found

A tragic lesson we didn’t wanna learn
Left us with all of these voices inside our heads
A pain we didn’t earn
Where did you go and do you know how much you are missed?
Where did you go and do you know how much you are missed?

There are things that death can’t touch
You’re alive in us

Wasn’t ready, can you hear me?
Will we ever meet again?
When you left us, had me fucked up
Can we learn to live with it?

We’re trying our hardest but the saddest part is how much you are loved
You’d be so damn proud of your brothers for being strong and holding on
Why did you go?
I hope you know how much you are missed
Wherever you go, I hope you know you made a difference

There are things that death can’t touch

You won’t be replaced

It soon becomes all encompassing
But there’s a way to find an escape
Without throwing your life away
And this is our war, war
I want you to know that I hear you
War, war
I want you to know that I feel you
Evermore
I want you to know that I’m like you
Evermore
I want you to know that I’m fighting too

Sometimes the world feels like an empty place
Sometimes it’s hard to face your demons day to day
Staring face to face in a mirror of shame
I know because we’re all the same

And this is our war, war
I want you to know that I hear you
War, war
I want you to know that I feel you
Evermore
I want you to know that I’m like you
Evermore
I want you to know that I’m fighting too1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Awaken me
Recovery

Can’t seem to find any peace of mind
Thoughts echoing in my head
Your memory is deafening when you’re not in my bed

‘Cause every time I think about you’s like a black cloud
I’m blacking out again
You never told me that it’d be like this, it’s too hard to forgive

Awaken me, recovery

I never knew that without you I’d lose the strength I needed
Now that you’re gone, I can’t move on
It’s like you’re haunting me

‘Cause every time I think about you’s like a black cloud
I’m blacking out again
You never told me that it’d be like this, it’s too hard to forgive
Awaken me, recovery
Ever since you’ve been gone, feels like I’ve been deceived
Emptiness, won’t you leave
Awaken, awaken me

I used to think that I deserved so much better
Used to think I was so god damn clever
I’m always learning the hard way
I need to learn so that you’ll stay

Stay with me
I know I’m a mess, fuck I’m a mess
And I think that I deserve this
If I must confess, be my witness
Be my witness

Awaken me, recovery
Ever since you’ve been gone, feels like I’ve been deceived
Emptiness, won’t you leave
Awaken, awaken me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I've forgotten who I am
Afraid that it's too late
Was I wrong?
Was there hope all along?

Can't remember when I felt alive
Illusions took hold
Lost myself but worse than anything
I woke up on my own
I remember thinking of impossible things
Of never backing down to impossibilities

Dreamer, where have you gone?
Dreamer, will you live on?
Dreamer
Dreamer, come home

There's nothing left but emptiness
When you realize what you could have been
Kept searching for the right moment
When you just have to live in it
You just have to live in it

 They say that time heals all wounds
But not yours, not yours
So you’re trapped in your mistakes
And now you’re who you hate

I know it feels like you’re sick of me
Describe what it’s like now that you’re missing me
Guilty apology, wasted sympathy

(Float here, I see clear)
Float away

You’re always chasing the next best thing
Float away
It doesn’t feel real till you feel the sting
Float away

I know it feels like you’re sick of me
Describe what it’s like now that you’re missing me
Guilty apology, wasted sympathy

You’ll never be whole, buried your soul

 I'll try to explain this
You'll understand if you're chasing greatness
The heartache, the mistakes
Are a part of what it takes to make it

I know you wanna play the part
No giving up when it gets hard
And so I'll be the one to show you
That pain defines you
The pain defines you

The river's flowing over me
I feel the current underneath
So why do I feel safe
When there's no escaping?
Your silence is deafening
When help is all I need
Why do I feel safe?
'Cause it's the only way

You want it, I've got it
Even though they tried to leave me heartless
Misguided, it's said that
You found yourself alone inside the darkness
It's hard to leave the ones you love
But it's a part of growing up
And so I'll be the one to show you
That pain defines you
The pain defines you

The river's flowing over me
I feel the current underneath
So why do I feel safe
When there's no escaping?
Your silence is deafening
When help is all I need
Why do I feel safe?
'Cause it's the only way

I wanted to be someone who'd never let you down (let you down)
But it's better to try and fail than never try at all

The river's flowing over me
I feel the current underneath
So why do I feel safe
When there's no escaping?
The river's flowing over me
I feel the current underneath
So why do I feel safe
When there's no escaping?

 If you're searching for glory, this isn't it
Searching for something good within

There's something we lack, it tears us apart
And says we can't be different
It's harder to see, they want us to fail
Derailed for their amusement

But you'll learn to escape
You're not bound to your fate
Create a better way
So now it's your turn
Light the fire that burns in all of us

If you're searching for glory, this isn't it
Searching for something good within
It's hard to be patient if you can't win
When the torture never ends
You're searching for glory
I'd die to find it

I can relate, I've used all my pain
To try and make a difference
I've wasted my time, devalued my life
And battled with my conscience
So now it's my turn
I'll light the fire that burns in all of us

If you're searching for glory, this isn't it
Searching for something good within
It's hard to be patient if you can't win
When the torture never ends
You're searching for glory
I'd die to find it

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Some people wish they were someone else
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's not worth it if you lose yourself
Oh-oh, I guess I'm asking for help
(Would you die to find it?)
(Would you die?)

If you're searching for glory, this isn't it
Searching for something good within
It's hard to be patient if you can't win
When the torture never ends
If you're searching for glory, this isn't it

 Tired of looking in the mirror
Cracks seperate my face
I'm not what you think
I'm lost in make believe
But why, oh God why are you doing this to me?
Can't stop looking out my window
I don't know who I am anymore
You'll wash, wash away all the secrets of my past
The shattered reflection is all I ever had

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy?

Devour the darkness (Hell find me)
Light defies me
Devour the darkness
Light won't find me (Light pulls us in)

'Til I severed everything she planted in my head
The further and further I distance myself
Can't help but see that I'd be better off dead

She's wrapped around my neck
Thought I had it all

Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"

Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Look at the sky, see a dying star
A white lie, sets a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts

Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

He can never get enough, get enough of the world
For a fortune, he'd quit
But it's hard to admit how it ends and begins
On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world
On his face is a map of the world

From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him
But he doesn't want to read the message here

On a mountain he sits, not of gold, but of shit
Through the blood, he can learn, see the life that he took
From a council of one, he'll decide when he's done
With the innocent

 Lie awake in bed at night
And think about your life
Do you want to be different?
Try to let go of the truth
The battles of your youth
'Cause this is just a game

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes me

It's time to forget about the past
To wash away what happened last
Hide behind an empty face
Don't ask too much, just say
'Cause this is just a game

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes me
Everyone's looking at me
I'm running around in circles, baby
A quiet desperation's building higher
I've got to remember this is just a game
So beautiful, beautiful
It's a beautiful lie
So beautiful, beautiful
It's a beautiful lie
So beautiful, beautiful
It's a beautiful lie
So beautiful, beautiful
It's a beautiful lie

It's a beautiful lie

 No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took, you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lied wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
(Heartbeat, a heartbeat, I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)

Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die, I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There's a fire inside this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God? Where is your God?

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
(Heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me?
(I really need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me dead?
(You know I gotta leave, I can't stay
I know I gotta go, I can't stay)
Or alive to live a lie?
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground

You say you wrong, you wrong, I'm right, I'm right
You're wrong, we fight
Okay, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Oh, the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God

Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground

Oh, this hurricane
Oh, this hurricane
Oh, this hurricane, oh
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?

 La nuit du chasseur

I was born of the womb of a poisonous man
Beaten and broken and chased from the land
But I rise up above it, high up above it and see
I was hung from the tree made of tongues of the weak
The branches, the bones of the liars and thieves
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil's inside

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Blessed by a bitch from a bastard seed
Pleasure to meet you, but better to bleed
Rise, I'll rise, I'll rise
Skinned her alive, ripped her apart
Scattered her ashes, buried her heart
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil's inside

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember

Tear you to pieces and rip you apart
Honest to God, I will break your heart
Tear you to pieces and rip you apart

 There was truth
There was consequence, against you
A weak defense, then there's me
I'm 17, and looking for a fight
All my life
I was never there just a ghost, running scared
Here our dreams aren't made, they're won

Lost in the city of angels
Down in the comfort of strangers
I found myself in the fire burned hills
In the land of a billion lights

Bought my fate
Straight from hell
Second sight has paid off well
For a mother, a brother and me

The silver of a lake at night
The hills of Hollywood on fire
A boulevard of hope and dreams
Streets made of desire
Lost in the city of angels
Down in the comfort of strangers
I found myself in the fire burned hills
In the land of a billion lights
I found myself in the fire burned hills

Time to be alive

Took our chance, crashed and burned
No we'll never ever learn

I fell apart, but got back up again
And then I fell apart, but got back up again, yeah

We both could see crystal clear
That the inevitable end was near
Made our choice, a trial by fire
To battle is the only way we feel... alive

I fell apart, but got back up again
And then I fell apart, but got back up again
And then I fell apart, but got back up again

The quickest tongue to divide and devour
Divide and devour
If I could end the quest for fire
For truth, for love, for my desire
My desire

And I fell apart, but got back up again

Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

When the lights go off, I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger, go on and play the leader

Make every second last

'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd

Live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home-team
I'll be the narrator, telling another tale of the American dream
I see your name in lights, we can make you a star

Watching from the floor
Take a breath, and let the rest come easy, never settle down, 'cause the cash flow leaves me
Always wanting more

 He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

The neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head
Well I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now

In a sea of sound
When I woke up alone
I had everything
A handful of moments
I wish I could change
And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
In a city of fools
I was careful and cool
But they tore me apart like a hurricane
A handful of moments I wish I could change but I was carried away

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
And you can keep all your misery

My lungs gave out
As I faced the crowd
I think that keeping this up could be dangerous
I'm flesh and bone
I'm a rolling stone
And the experts say I'm delirious
Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me

Arrogant boy, love yourself so no one has to
They're better off without you (they're better off without you)

They'll fall asleep without you

While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I don't believe in saints
They never make mistakes
I know it's not my place
Who am I to tell you that you need to change?
Her closet's such a mess
Filled up with all the skeletons she's kept
Nobody's perfect I confess
But she's perfect enough without ever dressing up, yeah

Dirty laundry is piling in her room
She's got her secrets, yeah I've got mine too
I don't care about what you did
Only care about what we do
Dirty laundry
Looks good on you

Now here's some honesty
Sometimes I trip over your history
Wish I could change my mind
But it's the things I shouldn't see that always catch my eye

Dirty laundry is piling in her room
She's got her secrets, yeah I've got mine too
I don't care about what you did
Only care about what we do
Dirty laundry
Looks good on you (looks good on you)

 Just a couple kids on a summer street
Chasing around to a flicker beat
Making mistakes that were made for us
We brushed them off like paper cuts

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye

Underneath the lights of a motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us
You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I want to know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you, how could I let you go?

You were the best thing that ever happened to me
And I'll keep on fighting just to make you believe

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I want to know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you, how could I let you
Don't want to let you, I'll never let you go5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Manage me, I'm a mess
Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
I wanna be laughed at, laughed with, just because
I wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
And I'm over
Getting older

If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here
Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel reckless, I wanna live it up, just because
I wanna feel weightless, 'cause that would be enough

If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

This could be all I've waited for
(I've waited, I've waited for)
And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere

 I can't take another hollow point conversation
It's getting hard to fake
The sound of you, an outlasting vibration
There's something I can't shake

The sweetness of you on my tongue
I breathed you in, you filled my lungs
A bitter taste, surrender waste
Another weakness

You and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take one down for the young and easy (young and easy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You get me out of my head
I fill this space in your bed
High on the beat of a breakdown (breakdown)
'Cause you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy)
And I don't wanna give it up

You caught me in a moment of redemption
There's nothing to explain
You had me on the edge of indiscretion
You said you feel the same
The sweetness of you on my tongue
I breathed you in, you filled my lungs
A bitter taste, surrender waste
Another weakness

 The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far

They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa, whoa
They left us alone, the kids in the dark

 I woke up on a Tuesday
Felt like a Friday night to me
Never wanna leave this bed
Tell me that you got nowhere to be
Can we stay all day? (All day)
Lay low in our lazy luxury
Sex in a rosé daze (Daze)
All day, it's a real good thing

Just like that (Woo)
There you go, making it hard to stay on track
Got shit to do, you got work
But we fall right back (Woo)
Into bed, like it's all just a game
And we can't help that, no, we can't help that
And we fall right back
Just like that

If I said, "I want your body", would you hold it against me?
Seven in the morning, wanna listen to Britney
Everything you wanna, baby, that's okay with me now
(We don't sleep, but we like sleeping in)
Closing up the curtains while you call out of work now
Turning off my phone while you take off your shirt now
Waste another day, 'nother night, 'nother weekend
We don't sleep, but we like sleeping in
Everyday's a holiday
We stay hot when it's cold outside, y'know
Haven't left your place in days
Postmates and dirty laundry

Just like that (Woo)
There you go, making it hard to stay on track
We got shit to do, you got work
But we fall right back (Woo)
Into bed, like it's all just a game
And we can't help that, no, we can't help that
So we fall right back

If I said, "I want your body", would you hold it against me?

I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it
I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage
I wanna drive this car right over the edge
Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet
I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic
Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic
I never meant to be hypocritical
This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical

And just like that, I know there's no turning back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'Til I hit an all-time low
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad
Once in a lifetime
I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it
I tell myself every night, I could live without it
I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness
But every time I do, I make another mess

And just like that, I know there's no looking back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it

Whiskey princess, drink me under, pull me in
You had me at "Come over, boy, I need a friend"

You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away to your radio
Backseat serenade, little hand grenade

Kiss the pain away to your radio

You take me over, I throw you up against the wall
We've seen it all before but this one's different

You send me reeling, calling out to you for more
The value of this moment lives in metaphor
Yeah, through it all

Filling up the empty space

Sittin' on your sofa, reminiscing over 23
You touch yourself the way I used to, now that's just a memory

Weekend wonderful
Fade-away youth
Summer symphony
What could I do?

We were getaway green
In a world of black and white
Getaway green
Like the Costa Mesa traffic lights
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Tellin' me I'm what you need
Like getaway green, getaway green

I know I'm not supposed to color in the lines when it comes to you
Undefined and out of mind 'til you get lost and lonely too
I guess I get the message, we don't have to stress this anymore
If it happens, then it happens, happy to have you at all

On the floor in my hotel room

Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I’ll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind
Thrills don’t come for free
The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers
I can’t find me anymore, anymore

I keep thinking about you
How you level me out sometimes
When I'm out of my head

What the fuck is the reason now?
Coming down, bring me back

There's a devil on my shoulder
And a monster in the television
Set me up for failure
All I wanted was some options

Like time is not a crocodile

Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway

Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time
The gunshot has gone off
But I am swimming in a footrace
There's no finish line in sight
And they already gave the first place medal

 There's a little house on a perfect little hill
Just short of a fairy tale
There's a little child with a million ways to feel
Caught up in a hurricane
Paper thin walls
Angry words from down the hall
Something changed them
I think about him every now and again

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark
I told myself that I wouldn't be scared
But I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm still having nightmares)
Every little thing got me coming back around
Digging up old memories
Always used to be the one to let it go
Kept my fears in a suitcase
I locked them away
In a place they wouldn't find
They still haunt me
I think about it every now and again

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up

I'm still having nightmares
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark (alone in the dark)
I told myself that I wouldn't be scared
But I'm still having nightmares

(The girl with the cinderblock garden)

Wait, I think we're on to something
We can't run from fate
But we can let it take us down
Down this road, where all our colours run together
Let's take the worst and make it better
Let's take this mess and make a home

I know it gets hard for you to stay
But do you really wanna throw it all away?
(I'm thinking)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Tonight, take all the ghosts and all those skeletons you hide
Bury them deep beneath the ground
Let them rest 'cause you weren't meant to bear that burden
Look at the roses in your garden
You can breathe now and forget

Forget it gets hard for you to stay
But we don't really have to throw it all away
(I'm thinking)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden
Just hold out for tomorrow
Our dreams will follow
Follow us back to when
When nothing was broken
The future was open
Let's go back again (Let's go again)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

 Nobody wants to hear a sad song
So I just grit my teeth and sing along
There's a choir of the coldest hearts echoin' the halls
So give a little more gas to burn
And we can fast-cut now to the curtain call

Melancholy kaleidoscope, it's high time
You shake things up and get the picture in your head right
Melancholy kaleidoscope, it's all right
Can't be one hundred if you're only giving ninety-five

I wanna hear another fast song
Somethin' to tune out all these bad thoughts
Light a fire in the coldest hearts, fillin' up the halls
That's another lit match to burn
And we can fast-cut now to the curtain call
(We now return to our regularly scheduled program)

Melancholy kaleidoscope, it's high time
You shake things up and get the picture in your head right
Melancholy kaleidoscope, it's all right
Can't be one hundred if you're only giving ninety-five
So would you please stand by?
Are we out of time?
Maybe I'll feel better
Give me forty-five
Staring at the ceiling
Choking back my feelings
Can't be one hundred if you're only giving ninety-five

Melancholy kaleidoscope, it's high time
You shake things up and get the picture in your head right
Melancholy kaleidoscope, it's all right
Can't be one hundred (No)
Can't be one hundred if you're only giving ninety-five

Oh, how I wish that it could talk back
I'd drive right off the Earth to find you
If it meant that I could see you tonight
And I know you don't belong (Know you don't belong)
Know you don't belong to anyone
No, you can't be tamed, love, and
Maybe I was wrong (Maybe I was wrong)
Maybe I was wrong for this
But you feel like the sun on my face

So can we close the space between us now?
It's the distance we don't need (Hey)
Yeah, you're everything I love about
The things I hate in me (Hey)
So come on, come on, come over now and
Fix me with your grace
'Cause I'm not too far and you're my favorite place

I saw your face in the fire again
I touched the flames and burned down everything
I hear the sirens west of 8th now
Wonder if you're hearin' 'em too
And I know you don't belong (Know you don't belong)
Know you don't belong to anyone
No, you can't be tamed, love

 Say goodbye to the halls and the classes
Say hello to a job and the taxes
The weekends with old friends spilling into 9 to 5 routine
Tell me how you feel over and done with
Like your life is a map with no compass to guide
At the bar drinking way too much
We sing along to "Forever Young"
So here we go again wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy
Don’t you see what you do to me?
I wanna be your lost boy
Your last chance, a better reality
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you’re with me say the word and we’ll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your "everything better" plan
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Somewhere in Neverland

We’ll start a life of the plain and the simple
Of great times with far better people
And weekends with our friends
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth
We’ll talk about how your parents separated and
How you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out
And trying to feel forever young
So here we go again wishing we could start again

 Artist:Falling In Reverse, 
 Yeah

I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay

Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay

Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah
Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now?

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster

 Do I know you?
Yes, you do
This seems so familiar
You're in a dream
Who are you?
I am your reflection
You've been asleep for a very long time

I lay awake every night, looking back on my life
Will apologies to the people I love for the things I've done really make it right?
I guess it might, just then I realized
My past is the reason I'm here right now, as a matter of fact, I won't apologize
You bitches always pissed 'cause I am constantly changing
Think of how far that I've made it from my incarceration, it's amazing, ain't it?
But I'm in the zone, I'm a rolling stone
I'm coming home, but I'm not alone
Do I really gotta let another motherfucker know?

No, I won't surrender, surrender
No, I won't let you bring me down

So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Like everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes
Uh, daddy?
Yes, honey?
Why did you go to jail?
Uh

I'm a lot smarter than you think
Everything I did was planned
To get you to listen, to get your attention
You post an opinion, and it gets me bigger
Are you triggered? Haha, figures
Here's the kicker, with every trigger
I'm getting richer from offended bitter little
Twitter bitches all up in my mentions, looking for attention 'cause they're starved of it
You wanna call me king of the music scene? I got news for you, I'm the god of it
Like the second coming
I respawn like I have a reset button, hated more than Trump is
Ronnie Radke's back to rapping
Acting ratchet, release the Kraken, delete your asses
I'm not the rapture, I'm the motherfucking morning after

No, I won't surrender, surrender
No, I won't let you bring me down
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Like everyone's out to get me

How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes

I need a miracle
I'm falling way too fast, I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up, if I could make you see
I'm all alone, all alone with your sickness in me

Dad, Dad, Dad, wake up
Ah, fuck, what the?
You were having a bad dream
Where am I? Turn the fucking music off, who the fuck are you?
I'm your daughter
Oh, no, no, you're too old to be my daughter, what year is it?
It's 2033, Dad
Oh, no, no, it's not, no, no, no, no (You've been asleep for a very long time)

 'Cause everybody's on drugs

Kill yourself is what they said to me
I'm already dead, just differently
They say God is real, I disagree
'Cause if that were true, then we'd all be free, all be free, ya, ya
Running from something that's killing me
Dealing with such an uncomfortable feeling
Beginning to feel the hostility from my ability
Of slowly becoming the villain
I just wanna thank all my fans especially
Without you is the death of me
I don't consider myself a celebrity
But I'll be doing this shit till I'm 70
This is my destiny, this is the best of me
It's an incredible feeling to grow
Letting it go, I'm letting you know
We're killing ourselves on the low

Everybody wants some, everybody gets none from me

'Cause everybody's on drugs
It's hard to believe, the American dream is a killing machine
We're all falling in love with a new disease
If it's killing you, then it's murdering me
It's all getting so unbelievable
We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
And you don't see that it's killing you
'Cause everybody's on drugs
Save yourself is what I'm telling you
'Cause nobody else really has a clue
Into your veins, veins, like heroin, -oin
Accept the pain, pain just to feel again, fe- fe- feel again

Everybody wants some, everybody gets none from me

'Cause everybody's on drugs
It's hard to believe, the American dream is a killing machine
We're all falling in love with a new disease
If it's killing you, then it's murdering me
It's all getting so unbelievable
We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
And you don't see that it's killing you

Everybody is dead from the neck up
Tryna keep their heads up, searching for a way out
This is a dying nation, so complacent
Spirits need awakened, what are we waiting for?
Fuck, die
Just die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
'Cause everybody's on drugs
The American dream is a killing machine
Everybody's on drugs
If it's killing you

It's so fucking unbelievable
We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
And you don't see that it's killing you

 I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find death staring in my face
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
Everywhere I go, I drag this coffin just in case

My body's trembling sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: "Feet, don't fail me now"

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

I got these questions always running through my head
So many things that I would like to understand
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?
I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: "Feet, don't fail me now"

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?


I've lost myself
You tried to reach me, but you just can't help me
So long, goodbye
You tried to save me, it won't work this time 'cause now

I've lost my fucking mind, and there's no fucking time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

 I've got the motherfucking world in my palm now, don't tell me to calm down
Striking a match, igniting the track while I'm typing in caps, it's on now
The rap Casanova with cash in a sofa in the back of a Rover
Six-pack in a backpack, and I'm cracking 'em open; sipping, I'm trapped in a moment
Open your eyes 'cause you're never gonna know if your next move might be your last
Living a lie, everybody's always gonna bring up my past
Well, I'm past that, interest up, and my bag's packed
I'm the NASDAQ with a bad rap, so

I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're pointing the blame
You know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused
And stay the hell out of my way
So why do you believe
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
In everyone but me?
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again

I've seen the hardships, lived in darkness, through the mud, into the marshes
My reputation is tarnished; but regardless, I am awesome
Saw the gossip from my lockup go colossal, then I blossomed to the boss of this rock stuff
And I'm never gonna stop till the cops come
What I'm really trying to say
Is say it to my face, and if you won't, stay the fuck out my way
Rocking shows, lock and load, stop me? No
I'm repping the new shit, the essence of music, I'm blessed with the fusion of both
I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're pointing the blame
You know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused
And stay the hell out of my way
So why do you believe
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
In everyone but me?
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again

Ever since I was a little boy, I always thought that the world was going to end in my lifetime
So I tried to seize every opportunity as it came to me because I believed it might stop the sky from falling down one more day
But the older I got, the more I realized that I cannot save the world
I'm not a superhero, I'm not perfect, I'm just me, a human being

So let's take, take, take the throne and break the cycle
So why do you believe everyone but me?
Every single day we kill our idols
But you won't break me down
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
We're losing our minds, losing our minds

I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're pointing the blame
You know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused
And stay the hell out of my way

Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed

And whiskey seems to be my holy water
Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters

Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sake's, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough

 I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find Death staring in my face
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
Everywhere I go, I drag this coffin just in case

My body's trembling sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I’m prayin', "Feet, don't fail me now"

I lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can’t believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

I've got these questions always runnin' through my head
So many things that I would like to understand
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of livin' life if it just contradicts?
I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I’m prayin’, "Feet, don't fail me now"

I lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can’t believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

I’ve lost myself
You tried to reach me but you just can't help me
So long, goodbye
You tried to save me, it won't work this time, 'cause now

I've lost my fuckin' mind, and there's no fuckin' time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you, can't you
Can't you see?
Can't you see?7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I've got my life laid out in front of me like roads, drawn on the map
I've had so many times where I slipped off the beaten path
I took the time to see the picture and for what it's worth
I'd walk a thousand miles without my shoes to make it work
I swore to God that I'm never coming back, kept my faith when I was clapped
Staring at the wall through a crack in the floor and these metal doors that got me trapped
I gotta remind myself that my mind is strong, so I won't lose my head
I've got my demons that I fight with every little thought and every breath

I wear my heart upon my sleeve so my soul's exposed
And I carry this disease, the weight of the Holy Ghost
God, can you hear me?
God is missing

Take it back, take it back, my friend
All the things that you said about the end
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over till it's over
Give it up, give it up, my friend
The score is settled even if you won't admit
Sun is up, final hour, without a doubt, it's over when it's over

You've got your life laid out in front of you like a car crash
Unconscious at the wheel 'cause you were driving too fast
But if you took the time to check up in your rearview mirror
You'd see the things you're driving from are your biggest fears
You gotta get back up from the wreckage above and walk right through the fire
No matter what happens, the fact is that the flames keep getting higher
You gotta keep it going, keep tiptoeing through the fire and the flames and the pain of knowing
The world is dark, gotta keep on glowing, gotta give that spark, gotta keep on glowing
I wear my heart upon my sleeve so my soul's exposed
And I carry this disease, the weight of the Holy Ghost
God, can you hear me?
God is missing

Take it back, take it back, my friend
All the things that you said about the end
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over till it's over
Give it up, give it up, my friend
The score is settled even if you won't admit
Sun is up, final hour, without a doubt, it's over when it's over

So please, please, just let me make my peace
I refuse to let your words be the death of me
Please, please, just let me live my life
Stop living in my shadow and just make it right
It's over, it's over, make it right

Take it back, take it back, my friend
All the things that you said about the end
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over till it's over
Give it up, give it up, my friend
The score is settled even if you won't admit
Sun is up, final hour, without a doubt, it's over when it's over, it's over
It's over, it's over
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over till it's over12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm here to say goodbye
No spell or prayer you try
Will bring me back to life
(Don't follow me, follow me)
So look me in my eyes
Sing me lullabies
Hold me til it's time

Don't mean that much to me
Now I'm floating near the atmosphere
No shackles on my feet
And I know I may be already gone

I miss the way it hurts
A blessing in a curse
For better or for worse
(Don't follow me, follow me)
Like a child, I have learned
Everybody waits their turn
Like a phoenix, I will burn
(Don't follow me, follow me)

Oh, this is it and I can feel my breath slowing
And my heart is beating weaker from the pain of not knowing
So kiss me on the face and wipe your tears from your eyes
'Cause this is goodbye

 It's nine o'clock on the dot at the spot, and I'm hanging with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place, and you're fashionably late
And I don't wanna be that guy that makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about making out with your friends, go

I love the way that this began, started off right, so innocent
I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go, I want your best friend
I'm giving it up and asking why you seemed so shocked and so surprised
I'm sorry it hurts, I'm surely a jerk, I understand why you're mad

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody knows I'm wrong

It's nine o'clock on the dot at the spot, and I'm hanging with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place, and you're fashionably late
And I don't wanna be that guy that makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about making out with your friends

It's got nothing to do with how you look, just another excuse to write a hook
I'm letting you know, she liked my post up on my Facebook
And after all, you're not my type, but all your friends are pretty nice
You know what I mean, stop making a scene and take some words of advice
Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody knows I'm wrong

It's nine o'clock on the dot at the spot, and I'm hanging with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place, and you're fashionably late
And I don't wanna be that guy that makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about making out with your friends

And I've got the topic conversation now
And I know I'm running out of time
It's not an honest demonstration now
You're not the only one, not the only one

Don't talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don't act like that
Everybody knows you're right
Everybody, sing along, ah

And I don't wanna be that guy that makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt; sorry about fucking all your friends

 Hahaha
Oh my god, that'd be amazing
Bad girls club

I met a girl, and I really thought she liked me
I truly thought that I had met the one
It was a fail, to no avail
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club
She's like a witch, casting spells, hypnotizing
She made me drink a potion just to fall in love
She got me drunk, tipsy off her love
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club

She's always blowing up my phone
I really wish that she'd leave me alone
I gotta change my number, hard for me to slumber
When she's outside my home
She called the cops
And made it seem like I was mean
She's not your average lady, she is fucking crazy
Spelled C-U-N-T (Bitch!)

And after all the rise and fall
You're not worth my time
I'm ca-ca-calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight, it's getting lame
So olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls, come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls club

I'm always paranoid (Yeah I’m paranoid, hahaha)
That she's somehow watching me
Follows me on Twitter, asking if I miss her
Hashtag: set me free
She Googles my name
Just to keep some tabs on me
She's not your average lady, she is fucking crazy
Someone, help me, please (Someone help me please)

And after all the rise and fall
You're not worth my time

I'm ca-ca-calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight, it's getting lame
So olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls, come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls club
Alright, alright, alright, settle down, settle down
I need all my bad girls in the house tonight to help me do a cheer
It goes: one, two, three, four
Hey, sexy boy, I got you wrapped around my finger
L-O-V-E really doesn't mean much
Your love is like a drug, but it is not enough
Give me a B-A-D, we're the bad girls club
Hey, sexy boy, I got you wrapped around my finger
L-O-V-E really doesn't mean much
Your love is like a drug, but it is not enough
Give me a B-A-D, we're the bad girls club

 Hey girl, I'm in love with you
But the world doesn't want me to
I'm not well, I am sick
The best kind of sick that one can get
So you can't believe a word they say
About the person I am today
If all else fails, just think instead
At least you know I'm good in bed
So trace the lines of my tattoos
Whisper that you love me too
We might as well, no matter what
They think I suck, but I don't give a fuck

So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life, I'm bad at life

Hey, girl, let's get out of here
View the world in the rearview mirror
Just me and you with nothing to lose
Electric love and something to prove
So, please, take care of my hurt heart
'Cause trusting you is the hardest part
You might as well, no matter what
They think I suck, but I don't give a fuck
So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

All your friends tell you I'm wrong
But all your friends sing this song
All your friends tell you I'm wrong
But all your friends sing this song, song
And I don't give a fuck

So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I told you a million fucking times
I'll give you bad advice because, I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I am bad at life, I am bad at life

 Tell me who you are, your father has forsaken you
Left you with those scars, my hope is that you'll make it through
Hate must never win, even when we're worlds apart
Your love is not a sin, even if it's hard

Even when I'm far, I will always be there

Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
Don't let your fears take control
I can finally hear her message loud and clear
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home

Transmission from the stars a message from the atmosphere
Etched into my heart, your purpose there is still unclear
The ghost of you lives on through everything I see and touch
And even when you're gone, even if it's hard

Even when I'm far, I will always be there

Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
Don't let your fears take control
I can finally hear her message loud and clear
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
A fallen angel is what you are
Your father has forsaken you
Left you with those scars
My hope is that you make it through
Hate must never win
Even when we're worlds apart
Your love is not a sin
Even if it's hard

Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
Don't let your fears take control

 My life is like a video game, trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Trying hard to save the girl, obstacles, I'm jumping hurdles
I'm growing up to be a big boy
I battle with the evil ways, I travel far and try and save
Sorry, but your princess isn't here
I take a rest, I push the pause, level up and move along
In hopes that the next stage I will clear; I fucking passed, asshole

I'm just trying to keep from dying

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
Stop complaining and start changing it

Today I went to therapy, told him my embarrassing
Issues that I'm having with my life
He told me that I need to change, life is not a video game
So stop playing and open up your eyes

I'm just trying to keep from dying
It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
Stop complaining and start changing it

Don't talk about it, just be about it
Don't ever doubt it even when your brain is clouded
I may be crazy, but life's amazing
And through it all and even with your problems facing
So just know that it's okay

My life is like a video game, trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, select, start

It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it
Life is for keeping score and forevermore
Stop complaining and start changing it
It's just a game that we play, and for heaven's sakes

 Brother, why'd you have to go?
You left us all so soon
Remember that song I wrote about your family years ago?
Well, they're waiting for you to come home
What do I do? What do I say?
And dad tells me to pray
So I've prayed and prayed, but the hurt won't go away
The pain gets worse, it never stops
And I've asked the Lord for us to swap
I beg and plead 'cause you have kids to feed

Why is it always stormy weather?
And, brother, tell me if it all gets better
Why did you leave? Why did you die?
You finally made your brother cry
I know you're watching over us tonight
And I hope you're watching over us tonight

I'm sorry I missed your call
I wasn't there for you at all
And know I thought it through, maybe if I answered you
That you would still be here, all along
Now, no more calls, can't you see
I took for granted family?
And once they're gone, you'll never get that back
No more laughs, no more hugs
So hold on to the ones you love
Your soul is free, I love you, Anthony
And why is it always stormy weather?
And, brother, tell me when does it get better?
Why did you leave? Why did you die?

Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through

I got that shit that you can bump in your car
Steady lurking on my enemies to settle the score
I am never backing down until the day that I die
And I don't give a fuck about no hater on my life
I am the best at what I do, and I will always prevail
And overcome all obstacles while walking through hell
And if you got a problem, now's the time to speak up
'Cause I'm blowing up, I'm never gonna stop

Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone

I spit the fire, and I'm killing the track
Ambitious from how many knives are stabbed in my back
And if you think you know me, then you're probably wrong
I spill my heart and soul, so lock and load and keep bringing it on
I got an anger that runs deep in my blood
And I'm always staying true, repping the city I'm from
And if you got a problem, now's the time to speak up

No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone

Don't get it twisted, ballistic, characteristic when I rip shit
Intricate visions of infinite, wisdom, empirical, spiritual, lyrical, very cool synonyms
In layman's terms, I am the best you must agree
I got that white boy swagger, rapping right down to a T
I got my hand upon the throttle, holding up a broken bottle
Ready to cut you up and gut you like a fucking avocado
Desperado on the track, in fact, if I am gone tomorrow
Then my motto is no sorrow, no apologies, just karma
Don't get it twisted and delete me off your friends list
Staying busy, tweeting hatred at me, all up in my business
I'm getting kicks outta this shit like it was my sneakers
And the game fears me like a motherfucking wife-beater, oh

Just let me go, on my own again
A rolling stone, I'm in the zone, yeah

Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone, and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be for clarity, I'll make it home

You're always searching for the next best thing, and it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever

Of the angels singing me to sleep while my feet are leaving the ground
Am I dead? Or am I dreaming instead?
A cornucopia of opiates have flooded my head
I'm insane, I am smart, all it takes is a spark
To ignite my bad intentions and do what I do best to your heart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves
Now the moon hangs in full, so you know I won't play by the rules

I will never spill
Spill my blood for you
You have let me down
One too many times

Someway, somehow, we've fallen out
Caught in between my enemies
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me

Due to mistakes I have made to the state
I am trapped inside a dillinger, diligently thinking of ways
To get out of this god awful place, I have learned that my fate
Is something I can't escape, so
Sound the alarm, what I've said from the start
Is I'll never let your system break me down or tear me apart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves
Now the moon hangs in full, so you know I won't play by the rules

This is where I draw the line
And I won't lose

Then you beg me to stay, but you want me to go
You're always telling me "yes", but your answer is "no"

Run, my love, I'm back from the dead
Let it go, it's all in your head
Oh, I could not believe that you will never let it be
And nobody knows all the trouble you've seen
I get it, sweetheart, we're always "low, low, low"
You're always pushing me away, but then you're pulling me close
So let's make a toast to all the years we've wasted
Hold your glasses high for all the tears we've tasted
I'm different now (You're distant how?)
Will we ever work this out?
You're always getting me high then you're pulling me low
Then you beg me to stay, but you want me to go
You're always telling me "yes", but your answer is "no"
If you want me to guess, I'm just a stranger you know
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just a loser
Yeah, yeah, guess I am a loser
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?

Yeah, yeah, look what you've become
Yeah, yeah, all the damage done
Yeah, yeah, I guess I've won
Yeah, yeah, look what you've become
Yeah, yeah, all the damage done
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking loser
Yeah, yeah, look what you've become

You're always getting me high then you're pulling me low
Then you beg me to stay, but you want me to go
You're always telling me "yes", but your answer is "no"

 I walk a fine line between coping and insanity
The right pills right now would be the wrong time
I have a hard time between flying and sobriety
The wrong thrill, strong will to keep myself alive
I've watched this rip apart my family
Fuck that (Yeah), I'd rather die with honor
But when the drug is running through me, I can feel no pain
It's not worth the price I pay

It's so hard to be together, and I try, and I try
But it won't get better, forever
Days go, days go by, I won't die, I won't die 'cause
I must, I must try forever

I missed a phone call from a friend I knew the other day
It's strange, it changed my life forever
A couple days go by, I found out that he passed away
The right drug, wrong time, he'll be remembered
There's two wolves (Yeah) battling inside right now
One's good, the other one is evil
If you're wondering which wolf inside will succeed
It's simple, it's the one that you feed
It's so hard to be together, and I try, and I try
But it won't get better, forever
Days go, days go by, I won't die, I won't die 'cause
I must, I must try forever

It's so hard to be together
And it won't get better
Days go, days go by
But I must, I must try forever

It's so hard to be together, and I try, and I try
But it won't get better, forever
Days go, days go by, I won't die, I won't die 'cause
I must, I must try forever

It's so hard to be together, forever
It's so hard to be together, forever

 I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I've got nothing to prove
But honestly, I'm just like you

I've got a bad case of ADD (Uh-huh)
I've been this way since seventeen
I got a fucked up brain and a really bad attitude
And I blame it on my drug abuse

So you don't wanna be too close to me
'Cause you might see my broken heart

I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that, honestly, I'm just like you
Just like you
Just like you

I've been so lonely for the longest time (Uh-huh)
They tell me that I'm such a lovable guy (Yeah right)
Could it be because I'm off my meds?
Or could it just be something I said?
You don't wanna be too close to me
'Cause you might see my broken heart

I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that, honestly, I'm just like you
Just like you

And I'm always stuck with some bad luck
I'm just a boy who's angry at his mom
And I hope, in fact, she breaks her back
The moment I step on this crack
And don't tell me I'm not worth it
'Cause you are far from perfect
I am aware that you are all assholes
Who the hell cares about all of that though?

I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that, honestly, I'm just like you

 "Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system"
Yeah
"Please, record your message"

Pick up the phone, answer your text
Well, I apologize about last night, I really did not mean to disrespect
You, you better be alone, no, I'm not obsessed
But if I catch you with somebody else, you know that I am gonna be upset
I truly believe that the reason I'm here
Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near
And one day you must look at yourself in the mirror
I still don't think that you are hearing me clear
You must understand that our friendship is done
Justified by the person that you have become
But because of the fact that enough is enough
Now I'm the one that is holding the gun

Whoa, this will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much, it hurts me, dear
And this, this will be the end of us

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Well I apologize about last night, I really did not mean to disrespect
Pick yourself up, up off the floor
Wipe the tears from off your face because the cops are knocking on the door
They're gonna wanna know what's up, better tell them that you fell
'Cause when they see the bruises on my face, they're probably taking both of us to jail
I'm sick and tired of fighting each other
The lying, the crying, the calling your mother
The calling of names, I'm bothered and smothered
We kiss and make up and get under the covers
A dangerous cycle I don't understand
The kicking, the screaming, the breaking of lamps
I'll be damned if I see you with some other man
'Cause if I cannot have you, then nobody can

Whoa, this will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much, it hurts me, dear
And this, this will be the end of us

Death do us part
I thought you would never go straight for my heart
I'm better off living in Hell

Pick up your phone
"Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system"
Pick up your phone
"Please, record your message"
Pick up the phone
Whoa, this will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal

Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
"I thought you was married to the single life", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me, you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit

I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely

She just give me face, ain't no fucking that's a no-no
And she going thirty early, dirty, no soap though
I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though
And I'm screaming, Fuck 12, all these foul ass po-po, yeah, uh
But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm
You see I can't ignore it
And you niggas don't see it's in your brain to snore
And you sleep on me until you can't no more
And don't fake on me and try to play the boy
I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me
Or why they feel like my intention's something ugly
Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me
Or why I feel like everyone just saying fuck me
Or why I feel like the opposition gon' buss me
If I gave you my heart, would you still love me?
Lately, baby, I feel like nobody trust me
Is it just me?
Haha, yeah, hold up

But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ah, ayy, ah, ayy, ah

Ah, ayy, ah, ayy, ah

I gotta get my fresh paper, boy optimistic, inflicted the premonition
My vision a place I visit while lifted
Moolah, I get it, get it, the life I live my decision
They told me to go and get it, I got it so now I'm winning (Remember)
Revolution of fury, the lean got my vision blurry
Balling' like Stephen Curry, gold fangs in my mouth so purty
Trippie bring demolition and I ain't talking no derbies
Absorb your flow like I'm Kirby, the lies you tell will not hurt me
Try to reach for the stars, yet people don't get too far
They want all of the money, all the expensive cars
It's few people that ever make it but yet I still gotta go hard
A lot of artists that made it are evil, hearts black as tar, yeah
Okay, and this is for every rapper that had a shot at sendin' me
Your efforts ain't getting you anywhere in this industry
Lyrically, demonically, dominate your flow endlessly
My venomous rhymes wine and dine on you mentally
Motivated the motivations, say I got too much chemistry
Fatality, like Liu Kang told me to finish 'eem
Even the Hulk couldn't take this much intensity
I'm the bullet in the barrel in the gun that shot Kennedy
Mind is racin' 'bout hating, contemplation with Haitians
Jamaicans sitting on 5G5 pacing, back and forth waiting in Dayton
You get the picture, don't take this
Boy, this life is real, you couldn't fake this (Remember)
Throw it up, regurgitation
Can't shit on me, you constipated
Is you mad 'cause we do this on a daily basis?
Yeah, or is you mad 'cause we made it?
Every day faded, we out here paper chasing
Bitch, ah, ayy, ah, ayy, ah, ayy

 Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot

 What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown

What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

There's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead

You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut

And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

Into one giant mess of hate and unrest

Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end
Are we just ladders in the world of snakes?
'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing me, sing me to sleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
You want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed

Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my
The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair, but we
We helped tie the rope
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead, I'm awake
The Devil told me, "No room for cheats"
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt
So leave a light on, I'm coming home
It's getting darker, but I'll carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving

 Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

 Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
When all you give a shit about is everybody else

And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit

Some people are a lot like clouds, you know

Hi, are you looking for the other side?
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?
Are you circling the drainpipe, getting off on pain like
You're corrupted?
I need to know where your loyalties lie
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?
Do you really wanna twist a knife in the belly
Of the monster?

Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off
Don't comе crawling back

Kingslayer, destroying castles in thе sky
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye
I'd sacrifice my life to find you, angel of the blade
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night

暗い、この見えない世界
まだ消えない未来
ただ手に入れたい another world
System failure
Life is encrypted, you are modified
Like a virus in a lullaby
Artificial 'til the day you die, silly programme
You're corrupted
Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system and back the fuck up
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back, you're on your own
さあ時の扉を開けて行こうよ

Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer, I'll fight for you until I die
Kingslayer, destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye
I'd sacrifice it all to guide you, never have to battle alone
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night

This is your wake up call
We're going down the rabbit hole
Are you ready?
I can't feel you
Oh, yeah

Is this what you want?
This is what you'll fucking get

 My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here, do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim or simply disappear?

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe, sing it
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

Wake up
Take my hand and give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and give me a reason to start again

Time stands still (Time stands still)

 Teardrops

We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

Is how we get this stressed out, paranoid
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down
And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
To be alone
So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

 I didn't see it coming (Coming)
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic (Magic), oh, no
Till it pulled us to that time and place
And I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking; it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain

So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this

And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
I never wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know

Yeah, all makes sense, right? Like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Such a bitter irony like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start

Brainwashed and feeling fine

Think I'm losing my fucking mind

Destroy yourself, it feels so good to fade away
Why do you wanna hurt yourself?
Die for something else?

Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption

Do you feel that? Yeah

Another day, another systematic nightmare
Commemorate a wonderful life
Bite me first, I'll bite you back, melodramatic laughter
I stabbed a knife in my eye
Think I'm out my fucking mind
Brainwashed and I'm feeling fine
Destroy yourself, it feels too good to fade away

 Put me outta my misery

Disconnected from the world again
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit

So I ask myself, when will I learn?
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired

Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

Sabotaged myself again
Got a brain like a hurricane
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
And I don't even care, no
Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (Oh, my God)
Think I'm looking at a long night
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Terrified (Terrified), I'm numb (But I'm numb)
Annihilation never looked so good, shut up
Hush your mouth, you talk too much

Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

And I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm in
The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath

Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

Artist:Bring Me The Horizon, 
 And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel
I just had to start again

The days are a deathwish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell
Throw me to the flames!
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze!
Watch me burn
How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?

 I've lost the plot again, tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made
And my soul's a sorry state, so come on down, you empty lovers
(Worms come out of the woodwork) And the snakes start to sing

Do you feel the chill clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill, did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll
Well, sharpen your teeth, tell yourself that it's just business

Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing

Don't say I'm better off dead
'Cause Heaven's full and Hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Well, you could lock me up in your heart and throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?
I'm just a woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been
Never was and never ever will be
Well, sharpen your teeth, tell yourself that it's just business
Woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been
Never was and never ever will be
(Worms come out of the woodwork) And the snakes start to sing
Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing

If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour the apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?
If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour or the apple of your eye?
Or just a step, a fucking step to climb?42EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I woke up in a warehouse but the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was then I heard the cannibals, cannibals
They said, "Hey, kid"

You got that something special, it's now or never
You wanna live forever, it's now or never
You know what we want, you should give it to us
It's now or never, but there's no pressure (Baby)

And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright, that's alright)

I tried to do a head count but I cut off all the crusts
Said they liked it better curly (Yeah)
Then they gut me like an animal, animal
They said, "Hey, man"

You had that something special, it's now or never
Let's keep it quintessential, it's now or never
You know what we want, why not give it to us?
It's now or never, but there's no pressure (Baby)
So I keep picking petals (I keep picking petals)
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore (You don't love me anymore)
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah, I keep picking petals (I keep picking petals)
Got my heart and my head all in the wars
'Cause some kid from A&R in a Patagonia
Says he don't really get it, no

*Beatbox*

So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know, do you love me anymore?
'Cause some kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore (You don't love me anymore)
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah, I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore (You don't love me anymore)
'Cause some kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan

 Hey, uh, are we rolling?
Yeah, okay; no it’s, that’s fine
I read a fun fact about the brain and
How it starts to deteriorate when
We get to 27 or thereabouts (Yeah)
It got me thinking about my head
And what I can do to help stimulate it
Makes me sad, but I’ve forgotten what I’m on about
(Ah!)

Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can’t sit there unless you’re righteous
I wear a happy face like I’m Ed Gein
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peel on
I wanna waste, I wanna waste, I wanna waste away
(Yeah!)

‘Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I’m on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I’m dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oi, Debbie Downer, what’s your problem?
Don’t wanna be here, still, call shotgun
You got the FOMO coursing through my veins (Yo, yay, yo, yay)
(This is) Not a drill, no, this is the real world
Domesticated, still, a little feral
Well, don’t you know to chew with your mouth closed?
(And it’s all gone wrong!)

‘Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I’m on the edge of a knife (Yeah!)
Nobody cares if I’m dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
Alright
I got a Type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far-out otherworldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I’m still down
Don’t tell me what the butcher does
There’s no need for the obvious
So ugly, still, it’s kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can’t think of an alternate
And hell yeah, I’m the awkwardest
But everybody knows I got bounce
(Yeah!)

‘Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I’m on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I’m dead or alive

Hoping the hole in my heart would heal somehow

But still, I'd kill myself for you
'Cause the truth of it, you could slit my wrists
And I'd write your name in a heart with the hemorrhage
Got me so fucking close to the edge right now

 It's so hard to let go
You can hear me but I'm invisible
But if you dig out your eyes, maybe pain will subside
The worst that could happen is you never see me again
But the worst is yet to come, my friend

This path I walk is comforting
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
I'm fading faster now

I left so long ago
You never noticed I was gone
Now that you don't have eyes, maybe now you'll realize
Within your own head, you're creating these lies
For what it's worth, you're still beautiful
But beauty lies within the eyes

This path I walk is comforting
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
I'm fading faster now
It's time to walk away with nothing left
Nothing left in my soul
I've faded into myself

This path I walk is comforting
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
I'm fading faster now
It's time to walk away with nothing left
Nothing left in my soul

 They appear
I remember when the fire was security, now it's killing me
A wolf can't hunt without its prey
So take me to my grave
The demons dance by the fireside
But tonight they migrate to my bedside

Burn the bed, burn everything
It's a lie anyway

There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left for me to be
Without you by my side

I cry but if you take a closer look
You'll see it's a demon's eyes
There's no coming back for me
For my spirit guide is trapped inside my brain
I don't know who I am
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
Close your gates, lock the doors, there is no hope
Burn the bed, burn everything
It's a lie anyway

There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left for me to be
Without you by my side

How could the world take you from me?
They all deserve to burn with me

What has the world come to when a demon defiles a witch?
Nobody trusts a word I say
I can't erase these memories
But I will erase humanity
Erase humanity

Burn the bed, burn everything
It's a lie anyway

There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left for me to be
Without you by my side
How could the world take you from me?

 This is our way of life
And we sleep away
Our misery in our bloodsoaked sheets

We've left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars, infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart and leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees
And recognize your newfound kings

Where we come from the saw is the law
When there’s no hope left, we will not fall
Among the giants, we still stand tall
And we will not be stopped

Just let it go and let the wind blow
It's like a hurricane inside of your head
The pressure's never ending, but your brain is still depending
And comprehending; why it is still defending? Just let go
And be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control
And we will swallow
This world whole
You are, you are nothing, we are everything
You are nothing without us


This is our way of life, taking cities one by one
Carefully choose your side, you could be one of many sons
This is our way of life, deafening ears and shutting mouths
Come and join our side, welcome to the deep south
This is our way of life

We've left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars, infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart and leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees

That our words don't mean a thing, so keep talking your shit
How can we honestly live in fear
When everyone will die in a hundred years?

Respect, trust and loyalty
I've gave it out and I've taken it too
But what's the point when everyone
Will secretly think they're better than you?

Come celebrate this day
It was slow and full of pain
Good riddance
I hope you're born again so I can have my turn
To beat you and cut you, put my curse upon you
To pass you down to my bloodline’s youth
Admit it all you want
The truth shall never set you free

Revenge is sweet but so is disease
When it turns you into a slave
Gather your friends and your family
So they can watch me spit and piss on your grave
Forgiveness is useless
It's just another form of weakness
This is for my family

Come back to life, I'll send you myself
Dig the casket from the dirt

You have no idea what I'm capable of
Keep claiming holier than thou
My knife can stab more holes than you can count
How dare you sleep where a king once slept
And dry the tears of where his queen has wept

Kill, torture, terrorize
Welcome to my mind
Terror comes in many forms
And tonight I'm terror, you're my whore
For now I'll leave you blind but still alive
So you can feel my presence stronger
This soil has cursed me
My inner demon's thirsty
You've confirmed to me the world isn't safe

My only worry in the world
Is that you can't walk on your own two feet
'Cause when you feel that last breath slip away
I won't get to see you fall down to your knees

Kill, torture, terrorize
Welcome to my mind
Kill, torture, terrorize

I feel alive, but you're not here!
Life, it changes
Wake me up, and bring me home
Bring me home!
Let me stay here forever

I can't see a thing
I'm lying in my bed, I can't stop thinking
It's driving me insane
Never got to say goodbye
It's still dark here...
It's still dark here...
And for the first time

I feel alive, but you're not here!
Life, it changes
Wake me up, and bring me home
Bring me home!
Let me stay here forever
I'll live on, and carry your name
And be what you always thought I could be
I hope we, meet at the end
But I'll never forgive the world, for taking my best friend!

I buried my tongue with my family's bones

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord to put me six feet deep
Put me six feet deep

Father forgive me for I have sinned
I know that we will all meet our fate
Even the beast of the underworld
Burns eternally within his own flame
Sleep my son, feel my embrace
Please don't forget my love

The moon is my light to a greater side of hell
But I am already there
Collecting my childhood nightmares

She's gone and I want to disappear, disappear
Take me away into the trees
I dread the sun to rise
Bury me so the night will never end

They say don't walk to the darker side
But where the light shines, the devil is alive
I've seen hell through a child's eyes
And I know in time, the devil I will find
The devil I will find

In time, I will escape
But in this place my soul remains encased
The leaves have swallowed the sun
My heart has reached absolute zero
I have no one left
Even my shadow has died on me
She's gone and I want to disappear, disappear
Take me away into the trees
I dread the sun to rise
Bury me so the night will never end

Tear him from his mother's hands
Turn this young boy to a man
Don't you cry for him now
Tear him from his mother's hands
Turn this young boy to a man
Now his destiny's found

Now I must live out this dark fantasy

That's why I am here to take your life

 My monument is progressing
Bereft is thy deed of completion
By all means you'll be alive, but not intact
I've sewn your lips to smile
With your own defecation on your lips
I'll knock that shit-eating grin right off your face
Abnormally disfigured designs
You observe the genesis of my abattoir
Reality accepted
You have no choice but to comply with my scalpel and my license to kill
My license to kill
Anal seepage flowing
I can't repress the urge
Thy coprophagist shall ingurgitate the filth
Grinding at your head with my bone saw breaking zygoma
I love these tools at my disposal, I'm alive
She cried out helplessly again
I ripped her limb from fucking limb
Just one less slut to walk this fucking earth
I will spit right in your fucking face
How does it taste
After the lips are sealed below your waist
You will never fuck again
My scalpel gleams, my attention cast aside
Hardening arteries begging for an inimical thrust
Byproducts of digestion soak the floor
I'm searching for a hypodermic syringe to draw the waste
Flowing in your jugular
The heart is pumping faster
As I lie and wait to watch you erupt from every orifice
The necrotizing fasciitis has commenced its work
No anesthesia applied
This will be everlasting
In the name of anatomy I shall dismember and attain what is rightfully mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 As I approach to the grasslands, I see a golden light
The moon never lies to a wicked eye
For my serpent tongue can only taste the flesh of an only son
Let my tainted blood flow through the parallels of our orphan veins
No man could ever understand the depths of our brain
Take a look at yourself, It's inconsequential
To stare into the eyes of a lost boy

Don't let the truth silence our voice
We have the choice to
Push the boundaries of our own consciousness
Can you not feel the vibrations?
Can you not feel the
Cold blood pumping into your blackened heart?

There's a world beyond the surface of our minds
Where absolute truth won't vanish from our eyes
Let the spirit divide our moral sense and pride
And descend together, forever you are mine

We are coming of age
And the life that you live will turn years into days
Haven't you learned from what she became?
It spawned a demon that ripped an angel from its wings
What is the purpose of living a lie?
When truth is revealed, you'll succumb to the eye's madness
Its power lives deep within us
We can return to
All that we have lost to this withered earth

There's a world beyond the surface of our minds
Where absolute truth won't vanish from our eyes
Let the spirit divide our moral sense and pride
And descend together, forever you are mine
Forever you are mine

Underneath my shadow is a snake
And it's telling me that
I should run far away
But I know its voice will be
Echoing forever (Echoing forever)
Echoing forever (Echoing forever)
Lost boy
We are one and the same, no matter how much
You resist me, I'm with you
We're in this together, you're mine forever

We are connected
We are the orphan sons
I am the voice that guides you
You're mine forever

How it feels to be demoralized?
The life you live is now rotten and cold
Go!

This is exile
We are the walking scum
This is exile
You are the sacrifice
And it was said
Blasphemy will now stand
They walk the earth
This is fucking exile

This world is ours and we will not stand still
This world is ours and we will not stand still
The dead will never rest
Vociferating hypocrites shall whisper every last word
And they will not be heard
Our death shall reign and our purpose exhort
False hope and lies we all glorify

This world is ours
This world is ours

This world is ours and you're totally fucking dead2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Go!

I know you can feel it, let it in
People will still hate you in the end
So hate back, plan the attack
Then they'll realize they can't crack the mind of a fucking maniac

The voice inside you always wins
Your graves been dug, so lie in it
And commit until the end for your dear old friend
And I promise that amends will meet at the end

Why can't I be anything without you?
'Cause the scars will fade, and you'll never age
When you'll give your life to the mark of the blade
The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything
If you'll give your life to the mark of the blade!

Yeah, you can come with me or you can stay and grow old
And let the universe swallow your rotting soul
Turn a blind eye to everything or take a chance
To be blind to model ignorance
Voice inside you never quits
It'll haunt you until your dying breath
So breathe in and breathe out, reach deep within
And I promise that amends will meet at the end

Why can't I be anything without you?
'Cause the scars will fade, and you'll never age
When you'll give your life to the mark of the blade
The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything
If you'll give your life to the mark of the blade!

Give your life to the mark of the blade
(Give your life)
I'll take your name beyond the grave
Give your life to the mark of the blade
(Give your life)
Give your life to the mark of the blade

I bleed the blood that is cut from the blade
I bear the mark and I won't be a slave, come with me and be saved
Why can't I be anything without you?
'Cause the scars will fade and you'll never age
When you'll give your life to the mark of the blade
The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything
If you'll give your life to the mark of the blade!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Eyes are glaring red with a conscience set to kill
Nostrils flared and the eyebrows parallel
Thriving on the chaos and the suffering I have caused on you all
A dispute of man and diabolical beasts

How could one cipher such a malevolent being?
I am certain of humanity's demise
We are the disease that spreads amongst this filthy race
I am certain of humanity's demise

Man will inspire the works of a new era of corruption

Now that I can control the orifice of mankind
I gladly inform, you're all in a world of shit
Coprophagia would be the only solution
Open your fucking mouth and ingest what you are
Silent you will remain, while I invoke my presence on your world
Urges I must satisfy again and again and again and again and again
Inside a shell festering is the mind of a bastard child

Cover the earth with the blood of this lamb
Cover the earth with the blood of this lamb
Cover the earth with the blood of this lamb
We are the disease that spreads amongst this filthy race
We are the disease that spreads amongst this filthy race
Collect the dust of the ones who have fallen to the lies
It is your last resort to a wretched memory
Take this life for granted and hold it tight
For we have you all under control because
We are the disease, we are the disease!
We are the disease, we are the disease!
For we have you all under control

Man will inspire the works of a new era of corruption

(God damn you) all!
Eyes are glaring red with a conscience set to kill

Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force-fed demise

Reality is dead by your force-fed demise

Get out of my head
Someone save me from this madness, I'd rather be dead
All I see is reality
Fabricated by something I refuse to see
You know who I am
You created me by letting yourself believe
Take my cold dead hands
And go six feet down, your failure is found

Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
From this self-imprisoned, self-made hell

Don't be surprised, this is your mind
Coming to life by self-sacrifice
This tragedy of death
Will walk hand in hand with every thought of regret
Blame yourself for what you've become
The mind is a powerful thing set to self-destruct (Destruct)
Mind-fucked (Mind-fucked)
You had your chance, your time, this is the end of the line
This is the end of the line

 Captivating with sadistic intentions to exalt the carrion
Holding onto faith like it would help me anyway
Up on my feet, vehemence takes over as I pave the way to anatomical feasts
Severing the ties I once endured to understand why it is that I crave the dead
Going by, my knowledge of popular culture!
I find a sense in malpracticing the common ways
Wallowing in claret, I long for such salvation
For when I'm through, I shall wear your pride upon my lips
Songs of the dead, will eternally be chanted
Before sepulture, I must purloin the genitalia
I must find pleasure when you're gone
An injection of sodium thiopental applied
Your eyes are getting heavy now, I smell your fear
Delusions and paranoia are setting in
Control in my hands, I now shall purge

With the saw I maim! By the saw I live!
With the saw I maim! By the saw I live!

Inhaling fumes of the putrid festered funk
As I drain the throbbing cysts from the gangrenous vagina
The mordant reek is overtaking every inhalation
The nausea is overwhelming, I stop to heave
Brought forth are my confessions to the dead
As the lies coincide with vitriolic clues
We all will spread disease
We're all deceased
Carved in your face; the sacrilegious rites
These words bring truth to what was foretold
Corpses and bile will reconcile
The rumors of this forensic plague

By these words I am one with the dead
And with this I've claimed the one which I'm wed
Until death do us part, we'll rot hand in hand
Until death do us part, we'll rot hand in hand
Until death do us part, we'll rot hand in hand
Until death do us part, we'll rot hand in hand1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 The devil is dead, I have never felt the way that I have
Until I left the valley in flames
Let it burn, let it die, blind the all-seeing eye
But I know smoke will never clear in Hell
The smell of burning oak makes me sick
Still I breathe deep, still I cross to the other side
(Other side, other side)
But I hear a voice behind me say

I (I), the еye closed its final time
As I had walkеd through the flames
Will (Will), the will of a beast
Is nothing compared to the will of a God
Find (Find), I'll find my peace
When the bones of the devil lay at my feet
You (You), you and I are one
Mark my words, I will find you
I will find you

A beast will always smell the blood of a coward
And a narrow-minded fool will always follow down the narrow path
To the blade that can make a God bleed
Still you are weak
You're just a boy with his mother's eyes (Mother's eyes)
That carries the weight of his father's heart
I always feel like there's something that I've left behind
It's not a possession or any acceptance of life
It's me
It's me (It's me)


What is the point of running away
When you don't know who you are?
I'll always be one step behind
Until you realize who I am

I (I), the eye closed its final time
As I had walked through the flames
Will (Will), the will of a beast
Is nothing compared to the will of a God
Find (Find), I'll find my peace
When the bones of the devil lay at my feet
You (You), you and I are one
Mark my words, I will find you
I will find you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Tell me all the things you want, I shall prove myself among the wise
I have failed you, grant my wish, I beg of thee
For I have done all the deeds you have asked of me
That whimpering, wretched whore who birthed your adversary
I retrieved her head and mutilated every last remain
The blood of the innocent I have spread with no fucking remorse
How dare you interfere, my monumental wake
Forever keep these words from my mouth

I will become the father of lies
Oh, the father of lies
I will become the father of lies
Oh, the father of lies

Holiest of holy, I ensure your crucifixion
Enlighten me, oh, noble one, of your mendacity
Give me the clearest view of your so-called commonwealth
We are your foes, annihilators of the sky


Limb from limb, the rites are carved into your forehead
Limb from limb, engorged into your psyche
Limb from limb, I smell the decrepit stench of your demise
Limb from limb, humanity will be destroyed
My procreator, I have warned thee of my prophecy
Until that day, stand your fucking ground

 Picking at my scabs again
I just want to see them bleed
I am numb and dead inside
Bring me back to life
I don't want to talk anymore
Close my eyes and stop my heart
Words only enhance the sound
Of what I don't care about

At what moment did you realize
That I meant nothing?
When did everything fall apart?

Help me
I'm begging, I'm pleading
I need you now
Help me
Running away won't get you found
Help me
Flesh and blood runs deeper than this
Help me
Help me find my way back home
Father, can you hear me?
I'm trapped inside a nightmare
Wake me up or put me in the ground
Mother, can you see me?
I need you to be there
Running away will never get you found

All you ever need
Is to shove that needle deep
And reach your eternal sleep
At what moment did you realize

 The mouth of hell is open wide tonight

You can't reason with a man who hates everything
I want to see everyone in pain
I can't change how the way things turned out, all I have now
Is regret, a match and some gasoline
I had it all, the woman of my dreams
All the money in the world and the sweetest little girl
The perfect life, the American dream
All wasted by insanity

Why do I do the things I do?
Why am I evil through and through?
What would you do
If you had nothing left to lose?

Spark the flame, let me burn
There's nothing left to live for
I've lost everything
So spark the flame and let me burn
Take my hand one last time
I need to feel you before I die
This is our last goodbye
Now spark the flame and let me burn
I won't lie about what I did
I cut her head off and threw it in a ditch
Why I only kept the body was a logical choice
I threw away the head because I hated the sound of her voice

Why do I do the things I do?
Why am I evil through and through?
What would you do
If you had nothing left to lose?

Spark the flame, let me burn
There's nothing left to live for
I've lost everything
So spark the flame and let me burn
Take my hand one last time
I need to feel you before I die
This is our last goodbye
Now spark the flame and let me
Burn

I am the devil's answer
I am humanity's cancer
I am the devil's answer
Burn me for eternity
Let me burn
Let me burn
I've lost everything
There's nothing left to live for now

Spark the flame, let me burn
There's nothing left to live for
I've lost everything
So spark the flame and let me burn
Take my hand one last time
I need to feel you before I die

 My conscious froze when I felt the cold embrace
Of the hand that crafted me
I set my soul ablaze, I crawled through the nether
And left a suicide letter next to my own severed head
I think I should be dead
But that's the beauty of selling yourself to sin
But again, we are men craving winter's end
Wishing to live within our origin again, yeah
The door to immortality is shut
I can't take much more of the scent of mold
This sphеre of madness burning in my gut
Has trapped mе in this house again

Mother, I pray that your voice sings me to sleep
To save my sanity from the sound of this bloodsoaked symphony
Father, I pray that your hand is warm again
My pain will never end until you both come back to me
Come back to me

I can feel the devil's presence, he never left this house
Now I can live my third depth fantasy
Draw him straight to me
And drain every last drop from his arteries
A sacrifice of blood wakes the eye
It looks to turn this iron into gold
I place my hand upon the ancient God
I surrender my life
I bring the gift of resurrection
The power returns from which it came
Now grant me what I have gifted
Mother, father, come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

In blood and bone, I carve an oath
To save this boy from this shattered home
Tonight we bathe in blood
And drink from the skull of the beast that left his heart so cold
In a perfect world
We could take his whole family's soul
And fuel our hearts with the hate I have
For the beast in us all

Mother, I pray that your voice sings me to sleep
To save my sanity from the sound of this bloodsoaked symphony
Father, I pray that your hand is warm again
My pain will never end until you both come back to me
Come back to me
Come back2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I don't think I'll make it
I take my ego and set it to the side
Forget who I am, reevaluate my life
Eternal doom is coming for me
I don't think I'll make it

Dripping sweat, I make my way to the other side
I don't think I'll make it
Clench my jaw and pull myself up to my feet
I've got to make it out
Through all the hatred and pain
I'll stand by my brothers' side
We'll overcome and make it out
To the other side

No regrets, no guilt or sympathy
I turn my back on the woes of history
Eternal doom is a distant memory
I've finally made it

Dripping sweat, I make my way to the other side
I've finally made it
Clench my jaw and pull myself up to my feet
I've finally made it out
Through all the hatred and pain
I'll stand by my brothers' side
We'll overcome and make it out
To the other side
We'll make it out

I am now free, I am godlike
I am reborn, the universe is at my feet

 Remember when we used to be inseparable
And the late nights sitting by the fire
We'd fall asleep knowing we would wake up by each other's side
We never had the fear that we were losing time
Remember the sound of the voice that would call our name
A sense of comfort fell upon our heart
Now the voice fades in thе distance, a life changed in an instant
I can't look at you bеcause it's tearing me apart

And I know you want us to be together
And I know it's hard to accept forever
Our delusion is the easy way out
But it's time for both of us to let this go

I didn't mean to hold you back from moving on
I understand that we can't keep going on like this
Can I just have one last moment to say goodbye?
I need to feel them against me one last time

And I know you want us to be together
And I know it's hard to accept forever
Our delusion is the easy way out
But it's time for both of us to let this go

And I know you want us to be together
And I know it's hard to accept forever

I thank you for every word you said
I thank you for walking away
I thank you for the promises you broke
For always watching, watching while I choke
I thank you for teaching me
Yes, I thank you for your hurting

I bite down a little harder, my blade's a little sharper
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow
Strike back a little harder, I scream a little louder
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you
I hit back a little louder, fuck you a little harder
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow

I thank you for the hole you dug in me
Filled it with cement, sunk me in your sea
Thank you for being so obscene
I thank you for never facing me
Swimming in the mud, never coming clean
I thank you for nothing in between
Yes, I thank you for leaving
I bite down a little harder, my blade's a little sharper
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow
Strike back a little harder, I scream a little louder
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you
I hit back a little louder, fuck you a little harder
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow

You wanna know why I like the pain you say
There’s some sick part of me thankful for the hate
I stay positive and I push forward ya see
I gotta do the right thing for my family
So I smile and I say that the world is just fine
As these fucking parasites eat up my spine
So I ask you once and I ask you again
Where do your roots start and where do your roots end

I bite down a little harder, my blade's a little sharper
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow
Strike back a little harder, I scream a little louder
My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you

The one thing you can’t live without
Yeah, I’m the girl you've been waiting for
I’ll have you down on your knees, I’ll have you begging for more
You probably thought I wouldn't get this far
You thought I’d end up in the back of a car
You probably thought that I’d never escape
I’d be a rat in a cage I'd be a slave to this place
You don’t know how hard I fought to survive, waking up alone when I was left to die
And you don’t know about this life I've lived, all these roads I've walked, all these tears I've bled

So how can this be, you’re praying to me
There’s a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

I can be your whore!
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

I’m the one that you need and fear
Now that you’re hooked, it’s all becoming clear
That all your judgments that you placed on me was a reflection of discovery
So maybe next time when you cast your stones
From the shadows of the dark unknown
You will crawl up from your hiding place
And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face
So how can this be, you’re praying to me
There’s a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

I can be your whore!
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me, you want me, you need me

Drop out, pregnant, statistical teen

You know I heard, I don't belong in this game
Still you hold your hands in the air, screaming my name, let's go

Baby, go ahead

This is killing us all, I don’t care if I fall
We’re the dying, we are the damned

Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen

Excuse me, can you tell me the worst thing you've heard about me?
Maybe that I'm a little harlot, homicidal queen
You know I heard that I don't belong in this scene
Sex Metal Barbie, whore, attention fiend
You know I heard that I'm a hater's dream
Low class, white trash, I'm so obscene
You know I heard, that I should be ashamed
Still they hold their fists in the air screaming my name
Baby, go ahead
I’ll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all, I don’t care if I fall
We’re the dying, we are the damned

Baby, go ahead

 My mother said that I was holy
My father said that I would burn
My mother said I was an angel
My father said that I would turn
So I believed these words and I turned on myself
'Cause maybe he's right, maybe I'm worthless
Or maybe he's wrong and my mother was right
I got a killer in me to give me purpose

I can feel a holy war
I can feel a holy war within
No, I can't take a holy war
No, I can't take a holy war again
Is this what you wanted?

I'm gonna bring a little Hell
I'm gonna bring a little Heaven
You just keep wanting more
With your blood and your whore
I'm gonna bring a little Hell
I'm gonna bring a little Heaven
It's a beautiful tragedy
You wanna be sick like me
'Cause I could bring a little Hell
I was told that I was nothing
I was told that I was pure (I was pure)
And I was told that I was dirty
Yeah, I was told I was the cure
And I ask myself, am I God or shit?
Am I the high, the low? I'm fucking worth it
And I ask myself, am I love or hate?
You are the reason I have and why I can't quit

I can feel a holy war
Yeah, I can feel a holy war within
No, I can't take a holy war
No, I can't take a holy war again

 You look at me like I’m a revelation
You wanna know if I can bring salvation
You saw a sinner, saw a saint inside of me
You wanna know if I’m a friend or an enemy

I waged war in a fiery blaze
I found peace in a purple haze
My angels and my demons
They don’t know their place
Ready or not, they’re gonna come out and play

I can be your heavenly or I can be your hell
I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell
I push you to the darkness just to pull you to the light
Cause I can take away your breath or I can bring you back to life
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil

I won’t pretend that I resist temptation
I think it’s funny when you preach damnation
I’ve been to hell and back and now it’s just a part of me
Without the darkness there’d be no light in me
I waged war in a fiery blaze
I found peace in a purple haze
My angels and my demons
They don’t know their place
Ready or not, they’re gonna come out and play

I can be your heavenly or I can be your hell
I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell

 Baby I’m sick inside
I’m definitely out of my mind
I know there’s something not quite right
Disconnect, system override
You’re so brave from your side of the glass
And you, you can’t compute, you can’t do the math
And you’re, you’re playing god with your remote control
But I already know that there's a flaw in my code and the
The truth is you silently study me
And there are consequences that you cannot see
And you ask yourself how did I unplug
But the simple truth is that I just don’t give a fuck

I don’t care, I don't care, I don't care
(Baby I don't care, no, I don't care
Baby I don't care, no, I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
You say you’re the cure
But I smell your disease
I’ve figured you out
Like a rat in a cage

So come in, tie me down, try and reprogram me
Please run your tests, tell me how I am malfunctioning
You cut me up, sew me back together one more time
I’m not in sync, data breach, can’t bring me back online, (you)
You start to panic when you realize you try to
Shut me down when you look in my eyes
No matter how hard you try and rewire me
Or psychoanalyze my psychology

Baby I don't care, no, I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
You say you’re the cure
But I smell your disease
I’ve figured you out
Like a rat in a cage

You put away your needles and knives
Tell me, do you feel satisfied?
Did you get what you came here for?
I can tell you still want more
Did you get everything you need?
Are you finished watching me bleed?
Did you think you could just walk away?
Did you think I’d just let you leave?
Maybe you didn’t think I would know
Maybe you didn’t think I would see
Cause I’ll never give what you want
I learned the truth a long time ago
I would die before I

Let me tell you how I want it
And exactly what I need
I'm here for one drug
I'm only here for one thing
So come on and tell me
Can you fly like you're free

Cause I need to feel
Yeah, I need to say

Push a little bit harder
Pull me into the speed

Are you ready to feel?

Artist:In This Moment, 
 Superstition and fear drove them all to accuse the friends and family of consorting with the Devil
Gathering around huge bonfires and repeating chants vindictive, the poor creatures to the flames
The lost souls cried out in agony as the flames grew higher and higher
Burn witch! Burn witch! Burn!
This is the Witching Hour

I can see the way you look at me
You can’t see beyond the veil
I can tell the way you run from me
I’m not your perfect fairy tale

Watch me burn
Can you feel me
Watch as I turn
What do you see
(and I am...)

Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the Witching Hour
(This is the Witching Hour)
(Burn the witch)
(Burn the witch)

Don’t you see the way I look at you
I can see behind your eyes
Can’t you tell the way I reach for you
I wear my halo in disguise

I watch you burn
I can feel you
I watch as you turn
What did you do
(and I am...)

Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the Witching Hour

You must burn for what you have done
You must burn for what you have done
You must burn for what you’ve become
You must burn

Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith

Addicted to my fate

 Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?

You keep pushing me right to the edge
You are sanctified and I'm just a mess
And you blame me for, blame me for everything you hate
And you wage your wars
No matter what I give, you always take

You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead, blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
I'll be your Joan of Arc
(Burn!)

You want to satisfy your high command
And you want to touch my face
With your dirty hands
So you blame me for
You blame me for the madness you create
And I wage my wars
Cause either way you'll burn me at the stake
You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead, blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
I'll be your Joan of Arc

Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?
And into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and angels!
(What do you want from me?)
Nothing. I am here to set you free

Go ahead, blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Go ahead, blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me (sacrifice me)

You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead, blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me

Everywhere I go, you go along with me (she said)

You see, I am the wolf
And this dirty, little piggy lives inside of me
You see every now and then
I forget which one I want and which one that I need
I have come to realize
That both of them have become a necessity
And I have come to realize
That I become which animal I choose to feed
Anything I say you lie along with me (she said)
Every song you sing is all because of me (I said)
Anytime I cry you always laugh at me (she said)
No matter what you do you will belong to me

Maybe she is just what they want me to be

Surrounded by our halo

I'll never let you fall
I won't let you fall now (Fall)
Mother, I won't let you fall now
Mother
Light the fires, let 'em blaze
Mother
Feel the storm through the haze
And no rain
No, no rain can put out these flames
Let me lay you down in the dirt now, the dirt now
So we can rise again

And I will stand up for you
There's nothing I won't do
I'll give you my everything

Down the river, we flow
Surrounded by our halo
I'll give you my everything

 I don’t need you to save me
I don’t need you to cure me
I don’t need you and your antidote, for I am my disease
I don’t need you to free me
I don’t need you to help me
I don’t need you, to lead me through the light
I will always fall, and rise again
Your venomous, heroine
‘Cause I’m a survivor, yeah I’m a fighter
I will fall, and rise above
And in your hate, I find love
‘Cause I’m a survivor, yeah I am fighter

I will not hide my face, I will not fall from grace
I’ll walk into the fire baby
All my life, I was afraid to die
But now I come alive inside these flames

You don’t want me to love you
You don’t want me to need you
You don’t want to look at me, for you will turn to stone
You don’t want me to hurt you
You don’t want me to bite you
You don’t want me or my aching soul
For I will only fall, and rise again
Your venomous heroine
I’m a survivor, yeah I am a fighter
I will fall, rise above
And in your hate, I find love
‘Cause I’m a survivor, yeah I am a fighter
I will not hide my face, I will not fall from grace
I’ll walk into the fire baby
All my life I was afraid to try, but now I come alive inside these flames

I don’t need you to save me
‘Cause I’m a survivor, yeah I am a fighter

I will not hide my face, I will not fall from grace
I’ll walk into the fire baby
All my life, I was afraid to die, but now I come alive inside these, live inside these, live inside these flames!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 What have I gone and fucked up again this time?
How did I become my own demise?
All these twisted little parts of me
Afraid of losing everything
So I, pulled the trigger and I fired away
I pulled the trigger and I fired away

Can you still hear my voice from afar?
Your dead flowers are still hanging on my walls
I felt God when you were near
For once everything seemed so clear
Until you, you pulled the trigger and you fired away
You pulled the trigger and you fired away

The shot you took was overdue
It’s a good thing I am made of scar tissue
Until you fired away
(Won’t you lay your guns down?)
You pulled the trigger and fired away
(Won’t you lay your guns down?)
Won’t you please lay your gun down?
(Won’t you lay your guns down?)
Oh, lay your gun down
(Won’t you lay your guns down?)
Won’t you lay your gun down?
Won't you lay your gun down?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 "So when they continued asking him
He lifted up himself, and said unto them
'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'"

Listen closely, to what I'm about to say
I think I've heard just about enough of your hypocritic ways
Don't try and stop me now
Don't you make a sound
You've built yourself up oh so high just to tear me down
I'm so tired of you telling me
How to live and what I should not be
And I'm so tired of you telling me
What to do and what I don't believe
And after all that you're telling me
Why is there hate and only you can see
And I'm so sick of you telling me
That I will burn, I will not be free

This is my song
My red crusade
What will I say?
What will I do?
Maybe it's fear that leads your rage
Maybe you're me and I am you
So go ahead and point your finger
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see this is who I am?
S-I-N-N-E-R
Natural Born Sinner

I'm not gonna change
So stay out of my way
I don't need you to understand
That I'm already saved
Maybe you should stop question all your pain
Can you look me in my eyes and say we're not the same?
Did you really think by pushing me
I would become what you want me to be?
And did you really think by hating me
I'd open up, I'd just hand you the key?
I know you're scared and don't understand
This is my life, this is who I am
What I do know is come Judgement Day
I followed love, can you say the same?

So go ahead and point your finger
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see this is who I am?
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R

SO GO AHEAD AND POINT!

 You, you’re everything I want
And I, I’m everything you need
This night is cutting into me
You tie me down, you watch me bleed
And we risk everything tonight
I, I am the misery you crave
And you, you are my faithful enemy
This hunger seems to feed on me
A sacred sin, a dying breed
And we risk everything
They can never know just what we’ve done
They can never know just what we’ve done
They will never know all the blood we’ve shed
The scarlet cross we bear until the bitter end
And they, they can never know just what we’ve done
Nothing good will come of this
I’m screaming out with my last aching breath
I’ll be yours until my dying day
But I can never see you
We, we knew how this would end
And we knew we’d die before we lived
But I’ll never let you go
I’ll never let you go
They will never know all the blood we shed
The scarlet cross we bear until the bitter end
And they, they can never know just what we’ve done
I will never let you go
They can never know just what we’ve done
I will never let you go
We knew how this would endEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Yes, the dangerous black widow is to be approached with caution, as the black widow’s bite can cause death
The black widow is easily recognized by her coal black body and red hourglass marking
She encases her victims with silk, and then kills with poison from her fangs
The male spider is not considered to be dangerous
Dangerous, da-da-dangerous
Dangerous, d-d-d-d-dangerous

Hey lady killa, come right in
I-i-i-it’s time for you, let the show begin
You’re so pretty, dripping sin
I-I you feeling it? I-I you feeling it?
Your eyes are screaming, I take the stage
A-a-a-a-a A fatal dance, a primal rage
You-you-you You pray for me, unlock the cage
I-I you feeling it? I-I you feeling it!

I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? G-g-g-good to go
(kill, eat the male, kill, eat the male, ki-ki kill, eat the male, ki-ki-ki-kill, eat the male)
I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? G-g-g-good to go

Love me ‘till you’re dead, you will not forget
You’ll still love me, dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)
Love me ‘till you’re dead, this is what you get
You’ll still love me, dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive
I-I you feeling it?
So here we are, make your move
We’re going mad, I’ll help our groove
(You want control)
You want control, I disapprove
I-I you feeling it? I-I you feeling it?
So watch me close, as I unveil
I’m stripping down, your face is pa-a-a-a-ale
You are the heart, I am the nail
I-I you felling it? I-I you feeling it!

I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? G-g-g-good to go
(Kills with poison, k-k-kills with poison poison, k-kills with poison, k-k)
I think you ready, you want a show?

You’ll still love me, dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive
(The black widow is dangerous, dangerous, d-d-dangerous, 12 times strength of steel, the black widow is dangerous, will readily attack 12 times)

 I think we should make out
In a few hours I'm getting on a plane
There's a pretty safe bet you'll never see me again, yeah
I love your accent
I wonder what it'll sound like when you cum
Let's see if Blondes or Brunettes are more fun

I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed, but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
And if I were you I'd bring your girlfriend, too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb
Ah

Let's take our clothes off
I wanna show you my hidden tattoo
That nobody ever gets to see but you do
Oh baby let me taste ya, shake ya, tie you up and break ya
'Cause I've been alone, left on my own for too long
Oh damn, too long, too long, too long, I say come on
I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed, but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door

And if I were you I'd bring your girlfriend, too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb

Turn your cellphone off
I put a sign on the door
I turn all the lights off
I left a sign on the door
I take all your clothes off
There's a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb

I'm on the very top floor room 1334

 Oh, I miss the misery

I've been a mess since you stayed
I've been a wreck since you changed
Don't let me get in your way
I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm tellin' you

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

I've tried but I just can't take it
I'd rather fight than just fake it ('cause I like it rough)
You know that I've had enough
I dare you to call my bluff
Can't take too much of a good thi-ing
I'm tellin' you
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

Just know that I'll make you hurt
I miss the lies and the pain, what you did to me
When you tell me, you'll make it worse
I'd rather fight all night than watch the TV
I hate that feelin' inside
You tell me how hard you'll try
But when we're at our worst
I miss the misery

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
I miss the rough sex, leaves me a mess
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

In the daylight, I’m your sweetheart
Your goody-two-shoes prude is a work of art
But you don’t know me, and soon you won’t forget
Bad as can be, yeah you know I’m not so innocent

Better beware I go bump in the night
Devil-may-care with a lust for life
And I know you can’t resist this
You know you are so addicted
Boy you better run for your life!

Welcome to the nightmare in my head (Oh God!)
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed (Oh God!)
Just give in and you won’t be sorry
Welcome to my other side
Hello it’s Mz. Hyde!

I can be the bitch, I can play the whore
Or your fairytale princess who could ask for more
A touch of wicked, a pinch of risqué
Good girl gone bad, my poison is your remedy
Better be scared, better be afraid
Now that the beast is out of her cage
And I know you wanna risk it
You know you are so addicted
Boy, you better run for your life!

Welcome to the nightmare in my head (My God!)

Welcome to my evil side
Hello it’s Mz. Hyde!

I’m the spider crawling down your spine
Underneath your skin
I will gently violate your mind
Before I tuck you in
Put on the blindfold
There’s no way to be sure
Which girl you’ll get tonight!

Welcome to the nightmare in my head (My God!)

 Some like beautiful, perfect, and pretty
I see the good in the bad and the ugly
I need the volume one louder than ten
Put the pedal to the metal, needle into the red
If the windows ain’t shaking
Making my heart race
If I can’t feel it in my chest
I’m in the wrong damn place

Got a demon in my soul
And a voice in my head
Saying go, go, go
I can sleep when I’m dead
There’s a sonic revelation bringing me to my knees
And there’s a man down below that needs my sympathy
I got a ringing in my ears getting ready to burst
Screaming hallelujah mother fucker take me to church

I like it louder than the boom of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound of guitar grunge
I like to crank it up, make it thump, I'm evil to the core
Headbanging in the pit and throwing my horns
And just like old school Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low and make it heavy
I like it heavy
Who-o-o-oa
I like it heavy
Who-o-o-oa
I ride the lightning, roll with the thunder
Going down, down, down with my sisters and brothers
I fell in love with the darkest parts
Standing on the side of the wild at heart
I plucked a feather off a crow so I could fly
Since I was 13 years old I’ve had my fist to the sky

I like it louder than the boom of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound of guitar grunge
I like to crank it up, make it thump, I'm evil to the core
Headbanging in the pit and throwing my horns
And just like old school Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low and make it heavy

Take me home tonight, I'd do anything with you
Buy a bottle of whiskey, we'll get matching tattoos
Tell me that you love me, oh, let me drive your car
We can sit to morning light, just countin' every star
'Cause if there's a Hell, I'll meet you there
And if there's a Heaven, they're serving beer
And if you're an angel, then I must be high
Oh, if there's a church, it's rock 'n roll
If there's a devil, I sold my soul
And it's alright, whatever we do tonight

 One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper and get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways to help you forget about her

That bitch can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites

My lips are pale and vicious
You're foamin' out the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason, I'm nothin' like the rest
I kiss you in a way, you'll never forget about me
That chick can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I

It sucks you in and kicks you down
And chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity by twisting all your thoughts around
They say it’s blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls and won't let go until you fall
I was down and out, got up, and said
“Hey love, I've had enough”
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never tame

Love bites, but so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I

 You don't know that I know
You watch me every night
And I just can't resist the urge
Just to stand here in the light
Your greedy eyes upon me
And then I come undone
And I could close the curtain
But this is too much fun

I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kind of love we make
When the line is crossed
I get off
I get off

There's so much left unspoken
Between the two of us
It's so much more exciting
To look when you can't touch
You could say I'm different
And maybe I'm a freak
But I know how to twist you
To bring you to your knees
I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kind of love we make
When the line is crossed
I get off
I get off

What you don't know
What you can't see
Is what I do for you
I do for me
I get off on you
Getting off on me
I give you what you want, yeah

 Am I brave enough?
Am I strong enough?
To follow the desire
That burns from within
To push away my fear
To stand where I'm afraid
I am through with this
Cuz I am more than this
I promise to myself
Alone and no one else
My flame is rising higher

I am the fire
I am burning brighter
Roaring like a storm
And I am the one I've been waiting for
Screaming like a siren
Alive and burning brighter
I am the fire

I've been sacrificed
My heart's been cauterized
Hanging on to hope
Shackled by the ghost
Of what I once believed
That I could never be
What’s right in front of me
I am the fire
I am burning brighter
Roaring like a storm
And I am the one I've been waiting for
Screaming like a siren
Alive and burning brighter
I am the fire

I don't believe I'll fall from grace
Won't let the past decide my fate
Leave forgiveness in my wake, oh
Take the love that I've embraced
I promise to myself, me and no one else
I am more than this
I am the fire

I am the fire
I am burning brighter
Roaring like a storm
And I am the one I've been waiting for
Screaming like a siren
Alive and burning brighter
I am the fire
I am the fire
I am the fire
I am the fire
I am the fire
I am the fire1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uh-ho

A fire's gotta burn
The world is gonna turn
A rain has gotta fall
Fate is gonna call
But I just keep on breathing
Long as my heart is beating

Someone's gotta hate
It's never gonna change
Gets harder every day (Uh-ho)
It's a hell of a place
To keep your heart from freezing (Uh-ho)
To keep yourself believing

But I won't run
I'm not afraid
I'll look 'em in the eye
Gonna hear me say
It's
My life, my love
My sex, my drug, my lust
My god it ain't no sin

Hope is gonna fade
The truth is gonna lie
Sometimes there's no reason
To justify the meaning

Watch as I make the pain my mistress
You can call me Miss Malicious
I'll dress you up in stitches
No, I cannot resist this
If it don't hurt I get suspicious
I like to take the knife and twist it
Yeah, my love is sacrilegious
I'm not scared to admit it
This violence is delicious

What doesn't kill me makes me vicious
I'm not gonna break
I can take all that you can give
This is survival of the sickest
I am not afraid, bring the pain

Watch out 'cause I'm vicious
And I'm not asking for forgiveness
Yeah, I make you go ballistic
Your torture is my business
And I won't leave a witness
I don't care if you hate me
'Cause you're gonna have to face me
And there's no use in crying
You know I would be lying
If I said you could escape me

What doesn't kill me makes me vicious

When it's all said and done I'll follow the echoes
I hear you night after night calling out my name
And I find myself running to meet you
I didn't want to escape
From the bricks that I laid down
You are the only one
The only one that sees me
Trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
Yeah it's perfectly reckless
Damn, you leave me defenseless
So break in
Break in

You let me fall apart without letting go
Then you pick up the pieces and you make me whole
I didn't want to escape
From the bricks that I laid down
You are the only one
The only one that sees me
Trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
Yeah it's perfectly reckless
Damn you leave me defenseless

And take everything I have
Till there is nothing left
Until it's just your voice in my head
And when the lights come on
You see me as I am
You're still inside me

You are the only one
The only one that sees me
Trusts me and believes me

 Black vultures circling the
Black vultures circling the
Black vultures circling the
Black vultures circling the sky

Feels like the end of the world
But it's only the beginning of it all
Forget the things that you've heard
I've been a survivor since I began to crawl

I've fallen down but I'm not out
The Devil's at my door

I don't give in, I don't give up
I won't ever let it break me
I'm on fire, I'm a fighter
I'll forever be the last one standing
Black vultures circling the sky
Pick at the pieces
Scavengers wait for me to die
But I'm not defeated
I'm on the edge of the war
I'm holding on and hanging by a thread
I am the eye of the storm
And you haven't seen the last of me just yet

I've fallen down, but I'm not out
I'm coming back for more

I don't give in, I don't give up
I won't ever let it break me
I'm on fire, I'm a fighter
I'll forever be the last one standing
Black vultures circling the sky
Pick at the pieces
Scavengers wait for me to die
But I'm not defeated

I am still alive
I am still alive

I don't give in, I don't give up
I won't ever let it break me
I'm on fire, I'm a fighter
I'll forever be the last one
Black vultures circling the sky
Pick at the pieces

 I’m on the train that’s pullin' the sick and twisted
Makin' the most of the ride before we get arrested
We’re all wasted
And we’re not going home tonight

Covered in black we lack the social graces
Just like an animal, we crawl out of our cages
They can’t tame us
So if you’re one of us, get on the bus

If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out
So shout if you’re a freak like me
You were born to burn
This ain't no disease, you don’t need a cure
It’s our time now to come out
If you’re a freak like me
If you’re a freak like me
We’re underground, but we will not surrender
We’re gonna give them something to remember, yeah
So write your name in gasoline
And set that shit on fire

If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out
So shout if you’re a freak like me

 You made me tough, you made me numb
You are the maker of what I've become
And now I am strong where I was weak
And I am unafraid of being me
So say hello to the monster that you made

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Thank you for the stain that you left on my brain
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine

Once upon a time you had control
And lorded over my poor soul
And I trusted you but now I see
You never knew the real me
And now I'm angry and you wonder why
You see the fire burning in my eyes
Once you had me but you lost me now
And there's no going back
So say hello to the monster that you made

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Thank you for the stain that you left on my brain
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine
My fear has died, my tears have dried
I don't feel afraid and I won't run away
I believe in me and now I see
Right through your lies, hiding behind your eyes
Because of you I'll make it through
And nothing can hurt me like you did, anymore

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Now there's nothing you can say to wash it all away
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine

 Found one of your old mixtapes
Remembering listening to "Grace", I do
But we were driving to D.C
I was drunk in your backseat, I know

Nothing will ever be
Like when we were seventeen
The stars will rearrange
The sun will fade away
Everyone will change
But we will still remain
And outlast the pyramids

I will feel you
I will see you
I will hear you
After the silence

Remember all the Philly nights
Driving down I-95
Singing in a smokey room
When we had everything to lose, I do
And when we got some room to breathe
You said that you would marry me
But even if we never do
I will always be with you, I know
That nothing will ever be
Like when we were twenty-three
Man's war will rage
And blue will turn to grey
Everything will change
But we will still remain
And outlast the pyramids

I will feel you
I will see you
I will hear you
After the silence, silence

The oceans can burn for all I care
And in the ashes I'll meet you there
I know someday the moon will blow away
And all flesh will decay
Everything will change
But we will still remain
And outlast the pyramids

I will feel you
I will see you
I will hear you
And I will keep you
After the silence
After the silence
After the silence
Silence, silenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Filling their empty lungs
With the wrong kind of drugs
Baby what have we become?
A billion empty skulls
Dumb and out for blood
Forgot about the love
Just another empty
Skulls

Damn, draw another line
Bring the other side
Make up another lie
If you can't see eye to eye
Feed your empty skull
Leave the tv on
Believe what you want
If you can't see right or wrong

I can't close my eyes
And make it fade
I won't shut my mouth and take it
God, no, I won't be another empty skull
No, I won't give you something beautiful (There it goes)

Start another fight
Better run and hide
Don't wanna hurt your pride
Eat your chemicals
Keep it nice and dull
There's no need to learn
When you think you know it all

I can't close my mind
And walk away
I won't shut my mouth

Never lose yourself
Remember that you're like nobody else

Life throws you into the unknown

There will be hope, there will be fear
And through it all, year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here for you

Dear daughter
Don't worry about those stupid girls
If they try to bring you down
It's cause they're scared and insecure
Dear daughter
Don't change for any man
Even if he promises the stars

 I do admit, I've come to like the attention
The heavy look in your eyes
So break a piece off of my latest obsession
A taste of pure paradise

I like the buzz because of what it does to me
I get a fuzzy feeling washing over me
I get a rush now honey when you're touching me
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?  Is it love?

I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you touching me
Is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz
I like it, I like it

Everybody's keeping their little secrets
Hidden in the bottom drawer
But when it's over there's a terrible fever
That keeps you begging for more

I like the buzz because of what it does to me
I get a fuzzy feeling washing over me
I get a rush now honey when you're touching me
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you touching me
Is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz

Oh yeah (I like it)
What you're doing to me, baby  (I like it)
Oh yeah, yeah (I like it)
Say, what you're doing to me

'Cause there's a new drug, baby, that I can't resist
It's like a thousand bolts of lightning when we kiss
And can you show me now, how can I get my fix?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

Is it love? Is it love?
Or just the drugs pulsating my veins?
Is it love? Is it love?
Or just a buzz running through my brain?
I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you touching me

 All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're loving on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're loving on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, “How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're loving on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think “How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
(It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away
(Away)
And now they're outside ready to bust
(To bust)
It looks like you might be one of usEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Drink the wine, my darling, you said
Take your time, and consume all of it
But the roses were only to drain my inspiration
The promises were spoiled before they left your lips, and

I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

I tell myself that you're no good for me
I wish you well, but desire never leaves
I could fight this till the end
But maybe I don't want to win

I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be sober
I want you on my mind
In my dreams, behind these eyes
And I won't wake up, no, not this time
I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

A familiar taste of poison
A familiar taste of poison3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 When I wake up, I'm thankful I slept through the night
'Cause that is the only time I feel alright
Keep my eyes closed so I sleep the sadness away
When I wake up, I'm sure that it won't be the same

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself: "I don't think of Death"
All the ups, all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
'Cause the truth is, I'm fucked up

The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah, we're all fucked up, it's true
The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah, we're all fucked up
And the truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they all just turn away
The truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they're all fucked up

If I wake up tomorrow, just know that I've tried
To find a way out without saying goodbye
All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself: "I don't think of Death"
All the ups, all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
'Cause the truth is, I'm fucked up

The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you

 I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead
For a few minutes, get me away from here
For a few minutes, (wipe away) wipe away my tears

For I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low, my friend, and now my heart does sink
Yeah, I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low, my friend, and now my heart does sink

It's like there's cancer in my blood, it's like there's water in my lungs

It's like there's fire in my skin, and I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath, please, tell me I am not undone

I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing this would end

Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead
I'll take another step for you
I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground
I'll take another breath for you
Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown?

On and on and on and on

When the dreamer dies (On and on and on and on)
So dies the dream
Turn me inside out (On and on and on and on)
Soak me in bleach (Soak me in bleach)

Only so much running
Low and running from myself
Only so much running
And the running never helps

When the dreamer dies, so dies the dream
Turn me inside out, soak me in bleach
Soak me, soak me, soak me in bleach

Soak me, soak me, soak me in bleach

 Kick it

Drag the lake
You won't find me
I've been tempting fate
With my heart beside me

I am the stone below the water
Cold and hard to touch
Just when you think I can't get lower
I turn my back and fuck it up

You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me

So come and drag the lake
You'll see I've done some diving
I had some extra weight
With no one to untie me
I am the stone below the water
Cold and hard to touch
Just when you think I can't get lower
I turn my back and fuck it up

You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me

I'll stare into the sun
To burn out what I've done
I'll tear myself apart
To see what I've become
Nothing wrong with my depression
My sick and miserable obsession
If I could only get some space
If I could only learn my lesson
If I could only learn my lesson
If I could only learn my lesson

You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake

 I bring the weather with me

It's time to lay my head down, I can hear the weeping song
There are sirens in the distance as the church bells sound along
Mourning ushers in the rain, clouds are heavy like their hearts
I sing to them their weeping song until their world is dark

We are all stars in the sky, we all shimmer then decay
So I wonder, did I burn out, make a mark, or fade away?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me

I'm the ship in the bottle, rain pouring down on me
I sing songs for my funeral that I will never see
You were my shining light, oh, you were heaven-sent
But now I'm not afraid of leaving, not of God and not of Death

We are all stars in the sky, we all shimmer then decay
So I wonder, did I burn out, make a mark, or fade away?
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I am the storm that never leaves
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I bring the, I bring the weather with me

Place the pennies on my eyes
I'll sleep with the stars tonight
Place the pennies on my eyes

 Drop it on the tongue like love
Even though you know it won’t be enough

Let me crawl back into your skin
We both know the hell I’m in (hell I'm in)
So if it takes me away for a while
We could touch heaven as we kiss the stars
I can forget myself
And make my way to where you are
We can fade away into the night
Close my eyes and I can feel alive

Drop it on the tongue like love (Like love, like love)
Evеn though you know it won’t be enough (Like lovе, like love)

Another star fell out of the sky
The night you took your own life (your own life)
And so I drop it on the tongue like love
Even though I know it won’t be enough
I can crawl into your skin
I know the hell you were living in
We touched heaven in the midst of hell
We kissed the stars before they fell
Drop it on the tongue like love (Like love, like love)
Even though you know it won’t be enough (Like love, like love)

We touched heaven
We touched heaven
Touched heaven in the midst of hell
They don’t know the pain we’re in
The hurt just beneath the skin
We touched heaven
Touched heaven in the midst of hell

Drop it on the tongue like love
Even though you know it
Won’t be enough
(I'll be in space)
Drop it on the tongue like love (Like love, like love)
Even though you know it won’t be enough (Like love, like love)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I won't be buried before my time, my time
I'm not searching for forever, I've got my eyes opened wide

Just looking for a reason to make your life last
No need to look skyward for you to find hope
No need for redemption to be saved from the rope

I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live
'Cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears
Let me give you my life, let me give you my fears

Just so you can hold on, and sing while I do
Sing these words out so loud like I sing 'em for you
This is your open letter, something to remember
We can still keep on fighting even though life is not forever

I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live

 Oh my God, I'm missing you!

Out my window, now the world is painted perfectly in blue
Time is moving slowly and my heart searches only for you
In the reflections on the water, in the movement of the leaves
Under the stones by the river, in the shade beneath the trees

My heart will keep on searching
I heard your name sail on the breeze
I turned my head to catch your shadow
But there was nothing there for me

My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window in my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow in an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you

Oh my God, I'm missing you!

The miles stretched between us, they're getting hard to bear
And more and more I find myself lost in melancholy stare
My heart will keep on searching
I heard your name sail on the breeze
I turned my head to catch your shadow
But there was nothing there for me

My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window in my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow in an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you

Do I surrender to the blue? Because I'm drowning without you
Spend my time staring at the sun, just waiting to come undone
The sound of static in my head, my heart is heavy, limbs are lead
Sick of living in a world so cold, I can, I will, I still stay gold
I know I'm doing the right thing, this is where I'm meant to be
I've been gone far too long now, I just want you here with me

My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window in my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow in an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
Oh my God, I'm missing you

 I'm still sick with my depression
Trapped inside my fragile shell
Is your God holier than heaven?
My heart's heavier than hell

The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and God's a lie
The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and He is lying

Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil at the bottom of the well
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil, and he's dragging me, dragging me to hell

My hands are chained, and I am sinking
To the bottom of the well
I can feel the water rising
My soul is too worthless to sell

The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and God's a lie
The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and He is lying
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil at the bottom of the well
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil, and he's dragging me, dragging me to hell

Dragging me to hell
Hell
I'm sick of chasing heaven, I'm going straight to hell
I'm chained down to my past, so I give up
I don't believe in God, no, I've got no time for that
Chained down to my convictions, I give up

The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and God's a lie
The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and he is lying

Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil at the bottom of the well
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil, and he's dragging me, dragging me, dragging me, dragging me to hellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Will they remember my name when I'm gone
When they know what I did was so fucking wrong?
Put the steel to my wrist, lost the breath in my chest
Just to forget all the wrongs I had left
I took the exit, left my friends in the gutter
Left my life right behind me, left myself, left it all
Left myself, left it all, not a falter, not a stutter
Not a note, and now there's nothing at all

Are you at all haunted by memories past?
Are you ready to make this one breath your last?
Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave?
Or are you just hoping that someone will grieve?

And now we roll on, I'm gone now
I don't remember much
I just know that
I would've been better off if I had stayed spoken to a friend

Let my heart keep on beating and not given it all up
For the grave, for the grave
There's no one there on the other side
There's nothing more than what I had
There's no ghosts left to haunt you, so you know I'm still here
Just the end of my life, nothing left here at all
There's no memories here, just the regrets of the dead
Please don't follow my footsteps, cherish all you have left
Are you at all haunted by memories past?
Are you ready to make this one breath your last?
Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave?
Or are you just hoping that someone will grieve?

There's no one there on the other side
There's no one there on the other side
There's nothing more than what I had
There's no ghosts left to haunt you

There's no ghosts, there's no memories here
Just the regrets of the dead
Please don't follow in my footsteps
Cherish all you have left
There's no memories here
Just the regrets of the dead
Please don't follow in my footsteps
Cherish all you have left

Are you at all haunted by memories past?
Are you ready to make this one breath your last?
Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave?
Or are you just hoping that someone will grieve?
Are you at all haunted by memories past?

 Misery loves company?
That don't mean a thing to me

I've seen the future where I don't wanna die
Sorrow wrapped around my heart like an unwanted vine
I've seen the future breaks the burden of my past
Painted black and all forgotten; you lit the fire in my heart

Sorrow floats where my dreams won't
Yeah, sorrow floats where my dreams won't

Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me

I've seen the future, and I wanted to live
Gotta think of that life each time I'm crossing a bridge
If hope floats and sorrow too, I guess I'll just hold onto you
The only one who really knows what I've been through
Sorrow floats where my dreams won't
Yeah, sorrow floats where my dreams won't

Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me
Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me

I just wanna die
I just wanna die, die
Black out the sun when I'm feeling low
Pull back the hammer when it's time to go

Loves company, loves company

Nothing to me, nothing to me

Oh God, I'm a broken man
Nothing left for me, and I am pleading

Take my hand, and we'll take flight

 Weighed down
Weighed down on the way down

I've lived behind a mask
So long, so few know who I am
They know other sides of me
That hide behind a haunted man

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They've saved me from myself
And they stand by me

Weighed down on the way down, I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe, and I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the comedowns, don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, way down

I'll fight fatigue, I'll fight for you
For everything that we've been through
I'll take your hand, I'll carry on
I've been weighed down for far too long
Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They've saved me from myself
And they stand by me, stand by me

Weighed down on the way down, I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe, and I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the comedowns, don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, way down

I won't be weighed down
There's too much resting on this
Never be weighed down
I'll fucking stand and resist

Weighed down on the way down, I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe, and I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the comedowns, don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down on the way down, I need someone to take my hand

 Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up
Let me hear you sing it
Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts up
So when the last light fades

Shine on, shine on young love
You hold my hands and I'll hold yours
Then life won't feel so wrong
I know you're hurting like I am
I know your heart's in your hands
We share a life so bleak
With broken memories

Shine on, shine on, young love
You've lit the fires in my heart, and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on, young love
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up

Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up
Let me hear you sing it
Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up
So when the last light fades
Shine on, shine on young love
We'll burn these fires bright
Let's blaze our past into the night
Because it's been too long
And we have been too down
So now it's sink or swim
And we're too strong to drown

Shine on, shine on, young love
You've lit the fires in my heart, and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on, young love
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up

I've felt as helpless as you
Felt the will to give in
Let your heart open up
Let the healing begin
Find your way to the light
And fight the will to give in
It's sink or swim
And we're too strong to drown
It's sink or swim
And we're too strong to drown
We'll take our time and make a change
This is our chance to sail away
We'll take our time and make a change
This is our chance, so let the last light fade

Shine on, shine on young love
You've lit the fires in my heart, and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up

Shine on, shine on, lifts us up
You've lit the fires in my heart and I won't give that up

 Stuck on the dark side of the moon
Stuck on the dark side, dark side

Our sadness was
Like two ships in the night, ships in the night passing
Both needing a lighthouse
We were yearning for light, yearning for light
Fill the ocean with tears; only I came aground
And if I close my eyes now
I can still hear the sound, I can still hear the sound

There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
And it's calling out to me
There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
Singing I can set you free

My friend, I'll forever have you on repeat
Stuck on the dark side of the moon
Your sadness, I hear echoing in the ether
You were the light in every room
If I close my eyes, I can hear you
Like you're singing next to me, you're next to me
Oh, brother, I hear you, I still hear you calling
"I have finally found some peace"
Brother, I still hear you calling
Never been so aware that I'm falling
Brother, I still hear you calling
Never been so aware that I'm falling
Stuck here, I'm forever mourning on the dark side of the moon

There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
And it's calling out to me

Singing I can set you free
There's a message at the bottom of this bottle

 Remember, remember, the times when we were younger
When we shed our tears so many times, close together
Remember, remember, the days we left behind
And the words lost between us in the valleys of time!
Remember my friend, now remember my lover

When I told you that I'd never recover
And remember the cold, the cold stormy weather
And the promise I made I'd love you forever
I meant it, I swear, that I meant it forever!

If my eyes are the oceans that put your head in the clouds
Then your heart is the reason I keep my feet on the ground
I've just watched the world turning, kept my head held up high
Kept my feet on the ground, kept the hope in my eyes

I meant it, I swear that I meant it and mean it
And after that time, I will always repeat it
I love you, I swear, and I won't let you go
That's something that I, really need you to know!

Remember my friend, now remember my lover
When I told you that I, would never recover? Well
If my eyes are the oceans that put your head in the clouds

Kept my feet on the ground, kept the hope in my eyes

I love you, I swear, and I won't let you go
That's something that I, really need you to know!
I love you I swear and I won't let you go
That's something that I, really need you to know!
And then you embraced me, with your entire being
And we were carried away off to a peaceful sea
Off to a peaceful sea!

Then your heart is the reason I keep my feet on the ground
I've just watched the world turning, kept my head held up high

 We struggle to our feet
We all yearn to be free
We fight yet we're weak
We all call out our grief
This goddamn life is our disease
But we can't always fucking weep
We can always turn the tide
We can all stand up and sing: "Never alone"

We fight together, not alone
We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home, never alone

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
We sink, or we swim
When we're drowning in our grief
But we can't ever lose hope
We have to stay afloat
We struggle to breathe
We can win if we stand and believe
We are lost on our own
But we'll find our way home
We can always turn the tide
And we can all stand up and fight, never alone

We fight together, not alone
We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home, we are never, ever alone

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore
We'll turn the tide, we'll calm the storm
We are ready for war

We are ready for war
We are ready for war
We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore

Never alone, never apart
'Cause we're the lonely hearts
Three, two, one, go

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts

Can't speak 'cause everyone around me is passed out
And my fucking mind is raging
Uh, hello? I don't even know why I called
I think it, I think it might be time for me to leave
Just call it quits, I'm sick of this
It's the same fucking day, every day
I think I sleep, I can't be sure though, it's all the same now
Drink, drink, drink again, I'm tired, man
I think it, you don't wanna hear this, I'm a mess
I'm sorry, man, I just don't know who to turn to
No one really hears me, you know?

So you're living in a nightmare, well, I'm living in one too
But I'm trying to prevent the storm from bearing down on you

You know hell is coming for you, now there's demons at your feet

You know love still fills your lungs

We breathe the same air, and you are far too fucking young
To let the weight of the world destroy you!
So one more night, breathe for me
I know the deep blue's stretched between us
But you are never too far from me!

 War, war

Divided doubt, grown to separate
Our weathered hearts search for home again
Too afraid to take those uncertain steps
But two years ago we were stronger then
Yeah, two years ago we were stronger then
(Yeah, two years ago we were stronger)
When we dove head first, we were so alive
Risking everything trying to change lives
Now, my red eyes filled with shallow compromise
Ripping tickets, split commitment, future undefined

I never wanted to watch us fight like war
And turn away from each other
We had to stop and surrender to restore
And find a way to recover
Losing all we should have been
Consequences made in this failure on to feel again, feel again

Blacked out, misguided rage
Grown to separate our hardened hearts from our resentful brains
No way to see how far down you’ll land
When the fall you take wasn’t part of your plan
Doomed if you do, disowned if you don’t
No way out for any one of us
Doomed if you do, disowned if you don’t
No way out for any one of us
I never wanted to watch us fight like war
And turn away from each other
We had to stop and surrender to restore
And find a way to recover
Losing all we should have been
Consequences made in this failure on to feel again, feel again

Cold like war
Cold like war

I bit my tongue, let the blood fill my mouth
I just smiled while I sat there and bled out
But, through this I found out where I stand
I will never betray me again

Cold like war

Always looked for the good or the best intent
After years that have passed I see all the signs I missed
Woah-oh-oh

Staring at my broken will that I'm too tired to hide

 We've planted a seed
An ever growing wonder to a beautiful tree
Grow
Each branch outstretched and different from the last, from the last
Where the old have broken arms some easier than the last
The right ones have grown in to fill in the gaps
And all are equal in love and trust
And all are a part of something so much bigger than this
Through the trials our tongues are tied
To trying times, so many unsaid lines, so many unsaid lies
Our lives were over at so many moments, so many moments
And now they're all just beginning
And now they're all just beginning
Our lives were over at so many moments
I have never been so consumed and I have never loved it more
To be devoted to letting all see what it is to live in the love of others
To live in the love of my brothers
And spilling back all that anyone has ever spilled for me
To show that to those who have never seen
Four years ago we planted a seed
Found that foundation that we need
Strived for the perfect balance
To show love and show compassion
And our vision for this world will not die when we are dead
When we are dead
And our vision for this world will not die when we are dead
When we are dead, when we are dead

All of my suffering on display
Is there solace in the struggle?

Grief, an open wound never healing
Brought to my knees, left with an echoing feeling
So tell me, is this it?
Is misery all that I'm left with?
Just tell me, is this it?
Can I get up or should I give in?
I carry the weight

Carry the weight, broken and chained
All of my suffering on display
Every day, is there solace in the struggle?
Carry the weight, broken and chained
Closing my eyes, I see your face
Every day, is there solace in the struggle?

As I'm surrounded by my grief
Brought to my knees
Unending pain, it fills the void that's inside my heart
Leaving an emptiness in its wake
And since the moment that you departed
I've carried the weight

Carry the weight, broken and chained

We're holding on because it's all we know
We're just holding on to say we didn't let go

Go on and say it
We've known for so long that this was over
I need to hear it
Your silence is the sound of closure
Hear me out

You're telling me right now
You're scared again and now you're losing composure
You're telling me right now
You cared but you were never honest
I don't even want it
No, take away our wasted age
No, take away our wasted age

The words you said show a side of you I haven't seen
Years of looking past what was in front of me
You're just holding on cause you can't let it show
You're just holding on cause you're too proud to let go
Go on and say it
We've known for so long that this was over
You need to hear it
The sound of closure

You're telling me right now
You're scared again and now you're losing composure
You're telling me right now
You cared but you were never honest
I don't even want it
No, take away our wasted age
No, take away our wasted age

Your voice is nails on a chalkboard
The sound of closure in the discord
Your voice is nails on a chalkboard
Your voice is nails on a chalkboard
Yeah

Are you listening now?
Can you hear the sound?
You're telling me right now
You're scared again and now you're losing composure
You're telling me right now
You cared but you were never honest
I don't even want it
No, take away our wasted age
No, take away our wasted age

You got me thinking it's over so hear me out
Your silence is the sound of closure
You got me thinking it's over so hear me out

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 Am I drifting through existence?
Is my life just passing by?
With the ever-growing distance
Am I leaving me behind?

Like a part of my past trapped in the hour glass
That will never break
That will never break
Will I breathe again
And let the colors in, surrounding me?

I wanna live lost in the moment
With my eyes wide, breathing new life
I wanna let go of the burden
With my eyes wide for the first time
Seeing time flying by, it won't stop
Cause today's all we got to lean on
I wanna live lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, woah

We've been drifting through existence
Cause we're trapped behind our eyes
We're to blame for our indifference
When nobody questions why
Like a part of my past trapped in the hour glass
That will never break
That will never break
Stuck in black and white
Drowned in old headlines
That nobody will read

I wanna live lost in the moment
With my eyes wide, breathing new life
I wanna let go of the burden
With my eyes wide for the first time
Seeing time flying by, it won't stop
Cause today's all we got to lean on
I wanna live lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, woah

I won't be caught in the hands of time
I won't be caught in the hands of time

I wanna live lost in the moment
Lost in the moment
Lost in the moment
I wanna live lost in the moment
I wanna live lost in the moment
With my eyes wide open with a new life
I wanna let go of the burning
With my eyes wide open for the first time
Seeing time flying by, it won't stop
Cause today's all we got to lean on
I wanna live lost in the moment
Yeah lost, lost in the moment again
Lost in the moment again

I won't be caught in the hands of time
(I won't be caught in the hands of time)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 So this is where it ends, the road we took together
Turn another page, however and forever
We only got one chance, the seconds are fading
Under the moonlight, we're wishing the same thing
I wanna remember, remember this moment
Remember this moment, remember this moment

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

Another line begins, I wonder what comes after
Will we be the same, or be in different chapters?
We only got one chance before it's all over
Under the moonlight I want you to hold on
We're gonna remember, remember this moment
Remember this moment, remember this moment
Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

This is it, we're never getting time back
I’ll admit, I’ll always think of what we had
(One last night to remember)
This is it, we're never getting time back
I'll admit, I'll always think of what we had
(Let's take this world together, now)

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand
Cause nothing's stopping you and me

Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

Cause nothing's stopping you and me

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 Every year goes by
Never ending change and I start to miss the ones I’ve kept the closest to me
(Their names spoken now in memory)
I’ve always tried to carry my words without deceptive cause but clear objective
I’ve shed the youth I lived in

My head feels so heavy my heart follows suit
Is this what I wanted to turn into?
You don’t have to stay
And wonder who I’ve become
I’m the story of the one you used to love
I’m the story of the one you used to love

Every time that I never seem to answer why I’m ignoring all the calls from home to be alone
A foreign voice or dial tone?
I’m ignoring all the calls from home to be alone
A foreign voice or dial tone?

My head feels so heavy, my heart follows suit
Is this what I wanted to turn into?
You don’t have to stay
And wonder who I’ve become
(You don’t have to stay, you don't have to stay)
Your eyes look so heavy, I had to concede
Is this what you wanted to prove to me?
You don't have to stay and wonder who I've become
Who have I become?
The story of the one you used to love
I'm the story of the one you used to love

I spent the morning looking down at the baggage claim
With yesterday, your hand in mine
Sitting as you laid a world away
And now the words soak into my head
That your chest has stilled
And I'll never see you again
I'll never see you again

I swear to God I tried to come back home
Be by your side, to hold you close
While the sorrow spread to divide us both
I swear to God I tried, I swear to God I tried
I'm the story of the one you used to love
(I didn’t want this)
I'm the story of the one you used to love
(I didn’t want this)

I swear to God I tried to come back home
Be by your side, to hold you close
While the sorrow spread to divide us both
I swear to God I tried, I swear to God I tried
I tried2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 Take me back
I wanna remember

I wanna go back to the days, undiscovered
Our hearts held inside our hands, and the world in front of us

Because I wanna remember
The way that we lived and who we were
I wanna remember who we are

I won't forget the memories, I know
You'll always be a part of me, and
Every way you changed me still shines through
You're the light that I follow home
Every way you changed me still shines through
I can't replace you
I can't replace you

I wanna go back, just to say, just to tell you
That your home is in my heart and you'll always live in us
I won't forget the memories, I know
You'll always be a part of me, and
Every way you changed me still shines through
You're the light that I follow home
Every way you changed me still shines through
I can't replace you

All the words you sang
We sing them back for you
From the first note
And all the words you sang
We sing them back for you
In every step we take
We carry on for you

And all the words you sang
We sing them back for you
From the first note
(The first note that was ever sang)
And all the words you sang
We sing them back for you

I won't forget the memories, I know
You'll always be a part of me, I know
I won't forget the memories, I know
You'll always be a part of me, and
Every way you changed me still shines through
You're the light that I follow home
Every way you changed me still shines through

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 We've been living in the shadows everyday
Are we ever gonna learn from our mistakes?
Our innocence, our ignorance, were lost but they'll be found
The innocence of years we spent

I remember the day, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

We've been given all these chances everyday
Another step to take in this could change
Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they'll be found
The innocence of years we spent

I remember the day, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?
Even though it's not the same
Remember when we made our first steps
It's always just a thought away, holding on to never forget
I still feel it now

I remember the days, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 To say I'm losing sleep is to assume I ever slept
Taking every comfort from me, leaving stones under my back
With a tongue that burns like yours and still a voice so bitter cold
Now I know, yeah now I know
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I can breathe, I can breathe, I can breathe
Now I can breathe in, now I can breathe in
To say I'm losing sleep is to assume I ever slept
Taking every comfort from me, leaving stones under my back
With a tongue that burns like yours and still a voice so bitter cold
Now I know, yeah now I know
I can breathe in, I can breathe in
I wish it was harder to watch you leave
The time that we spent never bought a thing
I can breathe in and finally let you go
I can breathe in and finally let you go
(I was trying, I was trying)
I was trying to breathe underwater
Just like two hands that can't hold each other
I was trying to breathe underwater
Like two hands that can't hold each other
So now your tide crashes harder
Surrounding my neck like a noose
It feels so much better to give up when you accept that you have nothing left to lose
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I'm not OK but you're not the better half of me
I can breathe, I can breathe, I can breathe
Now I can breathe in, now I can breathe in
I wish it was harder to watch you leave
The time that we spent never bought a thing

 This is an end, so I'm starting again to return to form
This is an end
This is an end

I never found peace, but now I'm fighting a war
All the vicious and greedy
Left me blind and confused
My illusions so grand
But my reality skewed
(My reality skewed)

I tried to be what they wanted, a hollowed cut puppet
Lying to myself to carry on like I loved it
They use my effort to feed
They sleep while I bleed
I've caught every vulture
I've clipped every wing
I've caught every vulture
Starve, you won't feed on these dreams again
This is an end, so I'm starting again
To return to form
(Return to form)
This is an end, so I'm starting again
Reborn
I never found peace, but now I'm fighting a war
Now I'm fighting a war

Their collapse was deserved
With delusions so grand
This is what they have earned1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Yeah

Sometimes I feel so wrong
Like I'm being held down
I feel my heart like a rock, it's sinking
These days can get so dark
Like an eclipse in the sky
But I can rise above
I can find the light

I can run
I can change all the answers
Or what I'll hope they'll be
I won't stop
I won't let my own questions
Fade away in my dreams
Don't fade away

We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Are you in or you out?
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
We all fall, crawl out of the fear you're in
Don't give up
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer, whoa whoa
So give me an answer, now whoa whoa
Give me an answer

Stand up
You have a voice to be heard
You're worth more than words
So let your fire burn
Oh, your flame will be lit
Again when a candle is burned at both ends
And there's nothing left

You can change
You can become selfless
You're not set in stone
You will wade through mistakes that we all make
But just hold on
Don't fade away (hold on)
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Are you in or you out?
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
We all fall, crawl out of the fear you're in
Don't give up
We won't fall to our knees

 Regenerate, regenerate this life
Regenerate, regenerate this life
We've returned to reclaim

On this unstable ground we're laying faces down
In a world that's sinking
Our faith is put in the stars, not in each other's hearts
In this world that's sinking

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own Hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together
We will regroup
Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change
We're searching for a cure
Cause our world is drowning
We're quick to guard our hearts
Forget we share our scars
In this world that's drowning

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own Hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together

Why condemn when you can confide?
Why condemn when you can confide?
You're all just too busy picking a side

 Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me all alone
You found me
You found me
You found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me

And she's long gone, when she's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, Oh

Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
No apologies, she'll never see you cry
Pretends she doesn't know that she's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning

Now I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see

She was long gone when she met me
And I realize the joke is on me
Yeah

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

And I killed my fears

I've looked death in the eyes, and she looked away

Any pain only feeds my will
Every doubt I've been conquering to grow
I'm back on my feet every time I fall
Every time I fall
I can't be stopped

 The years I'll never forget
Good and bad all the same
Every hardship we met
And dreams we got to create
The life I've chosen is true through all the borders between
And we'll share the view even if there's nothing to see
We were so young, we were so vivid
We were so young, awake and driven
I can feel it taking over, new ambition, though I'm older
We were so young, we were so vivid
We cut the arrogance from each others lives
Keep our feet on the ground, kill the ego inside
The life we've chosen is true since we were seventeen
And we'll share the view even if there's nothing to see
We were so young, we were so vivid
We were so young, awake and driven
I can feel it taking over, new ambition, though I'm older
We were so young, we were so vivid
And it leaves me in awe, twelve years this summer
No matter Heaven or Hell, forever my brothers

Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me go!

I hope that I will make it through to you
And in my steps you will follow behind, oh
Don't let me go!

Were too bright to see the spark
That I've been missing for too long
Something I've been missing for too long

Could never fill another

To make things better
But the love of all others
Has made me new
My empty cup
Could never (because of you) fill another

(because of you) to make things better (I am made new)
We've all been broken
So let us make each other new

All these distractions
Kept me from seeing what I needed all along
An understanding
I am speechless tonight
As I stare into the sky
I feel endless compassion, forgiveness, and love
I feel everyone who is looking up sharing this
I feel unexplainably alive
I need to understand what we've grown to be
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
So sing with me if you feel this feeling
So sing with me if you feel this feeling
Tonight, when I look into the sky

 I'll tear it down
I'll tear it down

You've flown way too high
Way too close to the sun
Feel the burn that you're falling from above
Another tale of failed ambition
Greed and wealth feeding your addiction
What's it like to wear a crown of dirt
Selling all those lies with that stupid smirk
What's it like to live the life of greed
Buying everything that you want and please

Don't get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
Your wings took you up
But you're selfish and you don't know when to stop
Dreams turned into failed ambition
Affluence fueling your dependence
What's it like to wear a rusted crown
When you know your name will never resound?
What's it like to be king for a day
When you know they won't even remember your face?

Don't get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime

You know you did this to yourself
Your only focus was on your wealth
Now you've flown too close to the sun
You're outgunned
Now I'm gonna bring you down
Overthrow the crown
Now I'm gonna bring you down
Overthrow the crown
Overthrow the crown

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
You know it won't, stand the test of time
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built won't stand for a lifetime

I'll tear it down, kingdom built on lies
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
I'll tear it down, throne of filth you built, down2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 I've been sleeping on stones...
My mistakes are easier made a second time
And I can't move on since I've closed my eyes
Since I've closed my eyes
I've cut off myself from everybody else
To move on is to grow
Yet I haven't been able to accomplish either
I know the way to go
Yet I can't bring myself to move forward
I've been sleeping on stones and they've formed to my spine
My once straight back, now a crooked line
I've broken no bones and I appear to be just fine
My life's been emptied from the inside
Every decision is easier made a second time
Every decision is easier made a second time
But once you start down one line
The distance becomes greater to change your mind
To change the way you're living your life
To move on is to grow
Yet we can barely accomplish either on our own
We know the way to go
Yet we follow those with their eyes closed
I've been sleeping on stones...
We've been sleeping on stones and they've formed to our spines
Our once straight backs now just crooked lines
When we all wake up inside the beds in which we lie
We will wish we had stopped the first time
When we wake up to the lives that we've created
We'll see we built nothing, but destroyed it
So turn around and head back the way you came
I'll follow you, encourage you
I'll follow you, encourage you
We'll be steadfast in our way
And as we make it back to where our lives branched off
We will take the path we should have taken all along
Once you start down one line
The distance becomes greater to change your mind
To change the way you're living your life
To move on is to growEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:We Came As Romans, 
 The devil on my shoulder tells me he's proud of me
That it takes a real man to look out for himself and no one else
I don't want to believe that
But sometimes it's easier to just stay silent
I wish I knew how to speak out
I never had a problem with words
But only when talking to someone else
There's a war inside me that's all my own
And I need to talk like a king to keep myself afloat
But how much longer until everyone knows?
There's a war inside me that's all my own
There's a war inside me that's all my own
I should have started to take my own advice
From the moment that I started giving it
But I can only control what happens from here
And if none of this had happened
Then I couldn't have heard...
The angel on my shoulder tells me he's proud of me
That it takes a real man to live for everyone else before himself
I know I believe it
And it'll never get easier
But it will always be worth it
There's a war inside me that's all my own
I'm still learning to speak out against myself
And stay on the path I truly want to be on
Though I've lost my way more times than I have wished
My heart is constant and willing
I still believe that we were made for more
That what I've been doing lately
This end of depression will be the start of getting back what I have lost
Because I had become conceited
But I'm making it back to where I last left off
And so I've shown you my heart
Will you restore me?
Will you restore me?
Will you restore me?
Will you restore me?2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I won't pretend that I can see the end
The light may fade, but I won't wither away
I won't wither away
I won't wither away
I am Darkbloom

Everything looks the same, I know it all too well
Am I numb and afraid of looking at myself?
Day or night, I'm fighting the feelings I hide behind
If it all comes undone, we'll black out the sun
I will find my own light that's buried inside me

I won't pretend that I can see the end
The light may fade, but I won't wither away
I won't pretend that I can see the end
The light may fade, but I won't wither away

Every choice that I make, the seeds that I sow
I'm faced with my pain like a fork in the road
Die or grow
When they black out the sun
I will find my own light that's buried inside
I won't pretend that I can see the end
The light may fade, but I won't wither away
I won't pretend that I can see the end
The light may fade, but I won't wither away
But I won't wither away

 Artist:Our last night, 
 Full of despair, inside a darkness
Self conscious and scared, held prisoner of war
Running out of air, buried in a sadness
Want a way out of this paralyzing world
And the sound of the cries when a family's loved one dies
It echoes through a vacant room where a young soul still resides

When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows
What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole
You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)

Searching for a way to escape the madness
A dire need for change as we fight for better days
The hurt and the pain cut deep like a razor blade
Holding in a cry for love, abandoned and afraid

When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows
What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole
You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
I won't go to my grave until a difference is made
I won't go to my grave until a difference is made
Until a difference is made

When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows
What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole
You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)

I won't go to my grave
Until a difference is made (until a difference is made)
Until a difference is made
From time to time, there arise among human beings, people, who seem to exude love, as naturally as the sun, gives out heat30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 When I was lost
I was searching for someone to be the light to follow through the dark
No one was there
I promise you when you're lost, I will save you
I wanna be the one to lead you through the dark
I'll never leave you
I promise you won't be alone

Looking back at it, I should've fallen apart
I can tell you the story of how I've got these scars
I was young, all alone, heart turning to stone
No attention, no love, all I heard was "Hold on"
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
It felt more than I can handle
I never learned, I never learned from example

When I was lost, I was searching for someone to be the light to follow through the dark
No one was there
I promise you when you're lost, I will save you
I wanna be the one to lead you through the dark
I'll never leave you
I promise you won't be alone
(Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone)
I promise you won't be alone
If you'd write a song, I'll listen a million times
And if I see that you're drowning, I would be your lifeline
You'll never be perfect, just know I understand
You've already shown me what it means to be a man
You can tell me anything, I won’t always agree
But I'll be glad you didn't bury it inside like me

When I was lost, I was searching for someone to be the light to follow through the dark
No one was there
So I promise you when you're lost, I will save you
I wanna be the one to lead you through the dark
I'll never leave you

These are my wounds to overcome
Even if the fight has just begun, I have won
These are my wounds to overcome
Even if the fight has just begun, I have won

When I was lost, I was searching for someone to be the light to follow through the dark
No one was there
So I promise you when you're lost, I will save you
I wanna be the one to lead you through the dark
I'll never leave you
I promise you won't be alone (Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 I know we both want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flames as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground

We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground

It's so hard to find the truth
When the other side wants to bury you, to bury you
It's so hard to find the way
When the other side wants to play you like a game
It's all about who's wrong and who's right
Don't wanna learn, we just just wanna fight
If different thinkers are enemies
Just think of what we could be if our thoughts were in harmony

I know we both want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flames as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground
We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground

We're stuck in a maze of conviction
Every path leads back to the beginning
We've built these walls between us
It's all about who's wrong and who's right
Don't wanna learn, we just wanna fight
We've been blurring the lines between dreams and reality
Only the truth could set us free

I know we both wanna do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flames as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground

We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground

Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
And it's forcing us to separate
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
And it's forcing us to separate7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I'm hurting deep down but can’t show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 You've got both ears on me
Constantly analyzing
Waiting for me to misspeak through
Selective hearing

Dissected nouns and verbs
Every single sound's been searched
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?
Holding my head to the curb
Lighting the match with my words
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?

I better watch what I say
With pitchforks and torches ablaze
You can't wait to turn the world against me
I better watch what I say
Before you tarnish my name
You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied
You've got both hands on me
Your death grip tightening
Showing no mercy or understanding

Waiting at every turn
Trying to dig up the dirt
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?
Following me in a hearse
Haunting my words like a curse
This is not what I deserve
Is it fun to watch me burn?

I better watch what I say
With pitchforks and torches ablaze
You can't wait to turn the world against me
I better watch what I say
Before you tarnish my name
You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied with lies
You've got my tongue tied
You've got both ears on me
Constantly analyzing
Waiting for me to misspeak through
Selective hearing

I better watch what I say

You can't wait to turn the world against me
I better watch what I say
Before you tarnish my name
You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies

Artist:Our last night, 
 You're my white tiger

Captivated by a perfect view
Time stopped and I found my muse
Brighter than the morning sun
Flames burned until the night was done
My faith in love was born again
From the clouds you were heaven sent
I could tell you were a different breed
From the way you looked at me

And there's no place that I'd rather be
When I feel your teeth sink into me
I bleed a color that I've never seen
A beauty that makes me complete
You're my white tiger, my white tiger

The first time I saw you standing there
Butterflies, all I could do was stare
So flawless and original
My heart dropped and I fell for you
Everything I was looking for
Like a wave crashing on my shore
Suddenly I couldn't speak
It's like an angel walked into me
And there's no place that I'd rather be
When I feel your teeth sink into me
I bleed a color that I've never seen
A beauty that makes me complete
You're my white tiger, my white tiger

As our worlds collide
Nothing could keep us
From ever leaving this place
As our stars align
They fit together so perfectly, yeah

And there's no place that I'd rather be
When I feel your teeth sink into me
I bleed a color that I've never seen
A beauty that makes me complete
You're my white tiger5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 I've been fighting the same old war
Against a disease, without a cure
Been holding on for so long (For so long, for so long)
I've been wishing upon a star, as my universe falls apart
I feel so far from the sky, as my dreams are flying by

And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns

Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes

I've come too far to go back now, to turn into a face in the crowd
Been on this road, for so long (For so long, for so long)
Convinced there is no way out, my world is turned upside down
My sense of direction's been gone (For so long, for so long)

And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes

Stay strong, keep moving, can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on, we'll be the ones that pull the stars down to us
Stay strong, keep moving, can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on, we'll be the ones that pull the stars down to us

Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Artist:Our last night, 
 Should we believe that human beings are just material things
Destined to grasp every little bit of happiness?
But without a purpose, do we truly know what we are good for?
Do our philosophies make sense when we truly test them?

I'm more than just a ghost in the machine
Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing
It's not easy to believe what our eyes can't see
But I am more than just a ghost in the machine

Can we battle a crisis of the conscience alone?
Life is a guilt trip, it was built in to a system that we live with
We can't seem to escape it
So we worship our idols and expect them to save us

I'm more than just a ghost in the machine
Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing
It's not easy to believe what our eyes can't see
But I am more than just a ghost in the machine

I can not be explained, no
I am no coincidence
Take me apart and put me back together again
I can not be explained, no
I am no coincidence
Take me apart and put me back together again
(Take me apart and put me back together again)
I'm more than just a ghost in the machine
Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing

 Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hiding?
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it

I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

Brick by brick we'll take it all

You think you're made of gold, untouchable
Consumed with power, you feel on top of the world
Deep down I know you're scared
Take my hand so I can pull you off your high horse
Take my hand so I can pull you off your high horse

A predator turned to prey, dissolved into a memory
You never saw us coming
Blind spots will leave you vulnerable
Hindsight won't save you now

Artist:Our last night, 
 Depressed and scared of death
You believe in a sun that never sets
When playing by the rules you didn't make
You can't expect to win

Don't you wanna live?
Don't you wanna be free?
In a world where you can sin
But you don't have to pray

You claim that it's faith and not that it's real
But you slave away so no one can steal
The place in the sky where you'll go when you die
I'm sorry, I just don't get it
(I'm sorry, I just don't get it)

You point you finger, you shake your head
Living by the book you think you read
I'd hate to say, "I told you so"
When the worms are eating your bones

You claim that it's faith and not that it's real
But you slave away so no one can steal
The place in the sky where you'll go when you die
I'm sorry, I just don't get it
If I said I knew the truth, would you believe me?
Would everything I do become your story?
If I said I saw your god, would you believe me?
Would my eyes become your only vision?
If I said I knew the truth, would you believe me?
Would everything I do become your story?
If I said I saw your god, would you believe me?
Would my eyes become your only vision?

Don't you wanna live?

The way those eyes look at me as I'm about to leave
I hold you close, can't you see that I just wanna stay with you
I promise to write you letters and I'll be back soon
Don't you worry, I won't let us fall apart
I won't let us fall apart

No matter how far we find ourselves
Our love will keep us close
I want you to know
You will never be alone
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I want you to know, I'm coming home

Everyday it gets harder and harder to breathe
Why can't we make believe
That we've got it all and we're young and we're free?
You're really all I need
I never found the right words to say
Kept it all inside, ignoring every ache
I get lost trying to close the distance between us
But I will follow my heart back to you
No matter how far we find ourselves
Our love will keep us close
I want you to know
You will never be alone
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I want you to know, I'm coming home

Take my hand just one more time
It's safe to leave your doubts behind
I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights
I will follow my heart back to you
I will follow my heart back to you
Take my hand just one more time (Back to you)
It's safe to leave your doubts behind (Back to you)
I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights (Back to you)
Take my hand just one more time
(Take my hand just one more time)
It’s safe to leave your doubts behind
(It's safe to leave your doubts behind)
I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights (The lonely days)

No matter how far we find ourselves
(Take my hand just one more time, It's safe to leave your doubts behind)
Our love will keep us close (I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights)
I want you to know, you will never be alone (Take my hand just one more time, It's safe to leave your doubts behind)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I will be with you through the lonely days and the lonely nights)
I want you to know, I'm coming home!4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 Perfect on the outside, broken on the in
Smiling for the camera just to feed our addiction

We're just fake
Advertisements selling artificial versions of
Ourselves, like fallen cities we disguise as paradise

It's like we're living in fantasy land
Burying our heads in the sand
Running from the dark, covering our flaws
So everything is perfect when we're living in fantasy land
(We'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned)
Living in fantasy land

The grass is always greener on the other side
Instead of sowing our seeds, we believe in little white lies

We display split personalities out on trophy shelves
To erase the parts of us that we don't wanna face

It's like we're living in fantasy land
Burying our heads in the sand
Running from the dark, covering our flaws
So everything is perfect when we're living in fantasy land
(We'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned)
Living in fantasy land
Stuck in utopia, a fabrication
Screaming out for help so silently
Stuck in utopia, a fabrication
Screaming out for help so silently

It's like we're living in fantasy land
Burying our heads in the sand
Running from the dark, covering our flaws
So everything is perfect when we're living in fantasy land
(We'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned)
Living in fantasy land
(We'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned)
Living in fantasy land
(We'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned)
Living in fantasy land

Artist:Our last night, 
 I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to (There's no one to turn to)
This all or nothing way of loving's got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal, somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes, when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Now the days bleed into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

Artist:Our last night, 
 Lone wolf, I was running by myself
I don't want, don't want anybody else
I'm solo, being on my own was easy
Thought that I was all I needed, but no
Then something changed
Something hit me in the face
I can't get you out my brain
I know this sounds insane
Thinking 'bout you every night
Like an addict on a high
I can't come down, down

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear to god I'll make you mine

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you

I'd lie for you, die for you
Take a bullet and I wouldn't think twice for you
Ain't nothing right now that I wouldn't do
You know it's true, you know it's true
Oh, I was so cynical
But now I never wanna let you go
My whole life changed
Something hit me in the face
I can't get you out my brain
And I know this sounds insane

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear to God, I'll make you mine

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you (Hell to have you)
Hell to have you
I'd go through hell1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 The desert air was sharp as a knife
The late autumn sky delivered the night
As far as I could see the road looked dark
The only life I knew was about to fall apart

Time's ticking and I can't escape
The pin pulled on a hand grenade
White flags start to raise

I wonder how it got this way
I swear it felt just like yesterday
We were fearless and unafraid

Take me back to younger dreams
When times were easy and we believed
Take me back to revive my memory
I'm digging deep but I am scared that I have lost
My younger dreams

Sick and tired of just trying to survive
I've forgotten how it feels to be alive
I can only hope I'm remembered by
The fearless heart that I once had inside
Time's ticking and I can't escape
The pin pulled on a hand grenade
White flags start to raise

Take me back to younger dreams
When times were easy and we believed
Take me back to revive my memory
I'm digging deep but I am scared that I have lost
My younger dreams
(Scared that I have lost my younger dreams)

I wonder how it got this way
I swear it felt just like yesterday
We were fearless and unafraid

Take me back to younger dreams
When times were easy and we believed
Take me back to revive my memory
I'm digging deep but I am scared that I have lost
My younger dreams
(Scared that I have lost my younger dreams)
I'm never turning back until I've found
My younger dreams3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Our last night, 
 Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort
All this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

I've been quiet for so long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long

I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

 There's too many minds around me
This company is making me crazy

There's voices in my head, breaking my spirit
Can't stop wishing they were dead, don't wanna hear it
Opinions in my head, my biggest fear is that they'll
Multiply and spread, don't wanna feel it
Looking, looking, looking over my shoulder
As paranoid, paranoid as a criminal

There's too many minds around me
This company is making me crazy
And I know I shouldn't care what they think
There's too many minds around me
I can't let my soul speak
I can't let my soul speak

Illusions in my head make me believe that
The monsters under my bed can hear me breathing

Artist:Our last night, 
 Whatever you do in life will be insignificant
But it’s very important that you do it, cause
Nobody else will

Can’t take back the cards you dealt
On this long and lonely road to hell
The throne must be such a sad and lonely place
Living breathing flesh and blood
Sweat and tears swept under the rug
I’m just a number to you, just ones and twos

The power keeps you feeling high, but how low
Do you sink into your bed at night
Anchored down with guilt?
Do you toss and turn from all the bridges you've burned?
Or are you proud of all the hatred you've earned?

A conscience buried deep beneath
A heart stuck in a skeleton of greed
And eyes that can’t see that happiness is so far out of reach

The power keeps you feeling high, but how low
Do you sink into your bed at night
Anchored down with guilt?
Do you toss and turn from all the bridges you've burned?
Or are you proud of all the hatred you've earned?
You can only get so far with no one by your side
A dark storm lies ahead, lies ahead
Can’t take back the cards you dealt
On this long and lonely road to hell
The throne must be such a sad and lonely place

The power keeps you feeling high, but how low
Do you sink into your bed at night
Anchored down with guilt?
Do you toss and turn from all the bridges you've burned?
Or are you proud of all the hatred you've earned?5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Y'all don't rеally know my mental
Let me givе you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn’t know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I’ma kill everything like this purge
Let's just get this straight for a second, I’ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin’ like kinetic, yeah

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la
Both hands together, God, let me pray
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my grind
Please do not, not waste my time

 I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
Wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I made the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe

Artist:Our last night, 
 A mother's love, close enough to touch
A false front was all it was
A passion so fake, controlled by the plague
On the darkest of days, a daughter was sold away

A worn heart numb to the pain
The hopeless tears fall from her face
Forgotten soul born in a grave
Fifteen years locked in a cage
Our daughters are too scared to stop them
Our sons, what have we taught them?
Have we really strayed this far from love?

Her body enslaved, innocent and underage
She hopes and she prays for someone to take her away
Holding her breath, waiting to drown
She's in over her head
The world is spinning while she is missing from it

A worn heart numb to the pain
The hopeless tears fall from her face
Forgotten soul born in a grave
Fifteen years locked in a cage
Our daughters are too scared to stop them
Our sons, what have we taught them?
Have we really strayed this far from love?
No one to even say goodbye
She sees no value in her life
This is not the rise and the fall of the tide
A pain in the chest and two watering eyes
Have we really strayed this far from love?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I was flying through a storm with a blindfold
You were hiding from the clouds under a rainbow
Walking through life, slipping on ice
But somehow we couldn't run from each other
I was flying through a storm with a blindfold

We met when we were broken
Everything out of focus
And our tides were rolling in and out
Then clarity fell on us
And our scars turn to dust
Our hearts were stolen
Even when we were broken

When we were broken

You saw the best in me
The things I couldn't see
Thе way I was meant to be
I saw the truеst you
Through all the black and blue
And now we're walking through life
Lost in paradise
You pull me from the grave and I change my ways
I was flying through a storm with a blindfold

We met when we were broken
Everything out of focus
And our tides were rolling in and out
Then clarity fell on us
And our scars turn to dust, yeah

 Caught in the storm

I know it's been a while
Since we last spoke
I hope you're doing fine
Out there on your own
Never thought we'd grow apart
We were together from the start
Scraping knees, collecting scars
Now I don't know who you are

It's not our fault
It's the way things are
But I want you to know
You're still in my heart

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walked through the door, our world
Would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do
We just got caught in the storm
Caught in the storm

I still look back on the days
When we'd sneak out of the house
Finding a place to get away
Where we could drink and be ourselves
Now we're stressed out and held down
To the life that we've laid out
But those times have shaped us
Into who we wanted to be

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walked through the door, our world
Would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do

The past runs away from us
Memories fade in and out
Time flies by before
We can even blink an eye
The past runs away from us
Memories fade in and out
Time flies by before
We can even blink an eye
We got caught in the storm alone

 Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody

Test my reality
Check if there's a weak spot
Clingin' to insanity
In hopes the world will ease up
Try to make it look like it's all somehow getting better
'Cause I know how to play it pretty good against the measure
Everyone started out a little insane
But we learn pretty quick how to fake it for the game
But some of you never learned to drop the act
So under that skin of yours: a heart attack

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

And if I had the answers I'd have written them out
So I can tell you what to do and what this thing is about
But all I've ever learned comes second-hand
And I dare not preach what I don't understand

You and I; we share the same disease
Cover up; compromise what we grieve
I've let more than my share of revivals die
This isn't pretty but it's what I am tonight

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

Pointing my fingers the problems still linger
They keep getting bigger and I hold the trigger
Running with fire, I live like a liar
Please somebody make a move
Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody make a move (The problems still linger)
Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)

Somebody make a move

Artist:Icon for hire, 
 This is the song I’m too scared to write
But some of you may need it tonight

Oh there you were, heart made of glass
Fragile little thing, shattered too fast
Tried to pick the pieces up up up
And that’s the way you first got cut cut cut
Devil drew you in, you didn’t let it show
Didn’t want the others to ever have to know
That you were getting hooked on up up up
And all you had to do was cut cut cut

You carved a special place for your pain
So it came back to hurt you every night
You closed your eyes and wished it all away
Until you disappeared under the knife

You knew the deal, no one gives a damn
Just another needy kid, sob story in hand
Keep your secrets covered up up up
We don’t need another cut cut cut
But you couldn’t hide a heart made of glass
You put yourself together with all the strength you had
You were finally fed up up up
Finally had to scream enough
You carved a special place for your pain
So it came back to hurt you every night
You closed your eyes and wished it all away
Until you disappeared under the knife

Listen- I know it’s simplified from the other side
It’s easy to gloss over all the messy reasons why
And it’s easy to forget where you’ve been
I guess that’s what the scars are for, huh?
When we were 15 we wouldn’t dare let that shit be seen
But now it seems mutalation’s gone mainstream
I see you at my shows, scarred up from head to toe
Like there’s no point even trying not to let it show
Cause we all know, emo kids like to hurt themselves
Too many feelings and not enough self control
And I mean, does this mess any of the rest of you
It’s an epidemic and we’re cool with it, don’t question it
But it bothers me, our scars are currency by which we’re measured
Like let the record show who let it slip and who held it together
Cutters and burners and honorable mentions
Posers who still cut themselves up for the attention

I don’t care your intentions, I just want you to know
My self-hatred never took me where I wanted to go
And at the end of the day, you know I still had to face
That I can pick at the pain, but can’t cut it away
And you know what else I can’t do is give you ten good reasons not to
I’ve racked my brain for clever sayings of all the things you ought to do
But you know, I think if there was something I could say
They’d have thrown it on a brochure- and sent you on your way
So I’ll keep doing what I always do: drag my heart to the piano and make it sing for you
I’ll keep doing what I always do: drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you
Drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I'm lucky if I ever see the light of day again
My skin is choking me, my feeble walls are closing in
This cell is filled with scholars easing me, they're teasing me
They told me "so, I didn't know the fall would be this easy"

How long until it starts to do me in?
I can't give out what I'm not breathing in
I know, they'll come with what I'm owed, guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty of all my deeds, despite my pleas, is death

Don't let go, cause
I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine, I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own, cause, I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine, I know
Don't let go, don't let go, savior

Your way to life has only shown me what a fool I am
It serves the purpose of confirming I remain condemned
And I will ever linger on the edge
Unless you hear me
How long until it starts to do me in?
I can't give out what I'm not breathing in
I know, they'll come with what I'm owed, guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty of all my deeds, despite my pleas, is death


Don't let go, cause

Death is mine, I know

Artist:Icon for hire, 
 My mind's a kaleidoscope, it thinks too fast
Blurs all the colors 'til I can't see past
The last mistake, the choice I made
Staring in the mirror with myself to blame
Sometimes I'm afraid of the thoughts inside
Nowhere to hide inside my mind
I'm scared that you'll compare and I'll look a lifetime past repair
I second guess myself to death, I re-solicit every step
What if my words are meaningless? What if my heart's misleading this?
I try to capture every moment as it comes to me
Bottle up the memories and let them keep me company

When the hope of morning starts to fade in me
I don't dare let darkness have its way with me
And the hope of morning makes me worth the fight
I will not be giving in tonight

When I'm old and grey, or thirty, or whatever happens first
I'll need you to reassure me I didn't waste a verse
Or worse, what if my life's work is reduced to just myself
Like never let you get a word in, while I dissect my mental health
Or lack thereof, whatever, there's too many things to track
I really can't remember if I'm insane or insomniac
Now days, all the kids want crazy, wanna diagnose themselves
Trade up made up epidemics, pass around prescription pills
But my disorder can't be cured by a bottle, blade, or dose
Self-disgust and selfishness tend to hold me awfully close
But I don't wanna let you see that, I don't want my friends to know
Self-disgust and selfishness take me everywhere I go
When the hope of morning starts to fade in me
I don't dare let darkness have its way with me
And the hope of morning makes me worth the fight
I will not be giving in tonight

Try as I might to keep it together
Why is recovery taking forever?
Fool the whole world, just until I get better
I'm terrified I'll be faking forever
(Faking forever)
On and on I wonder what went wrong inside my head
I don't have to have the answers, but tonight I wish I did
All the pain I can't explain away won't fade
All the the secrets silenced by the shame
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it

When the hope of morning starts to fade in me
I don't dare let darkness have its way with me
And the hope of morning makes me worth the fight
I will not be giving in tonight4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 We throw tantrums like parties
We're not happy 'till everyone knows we're sick
And that's just how we like it
We've hurt bad enough, right, we've earned it

Don't tell the others, but it's all getting old
I mean, how any more times must our stories be told?
And being lonely's only fun in a group
It sort of loses it's charm when it's true

I meant it when I said I wanna get well, I wanna get well
Are the rest of you so content?
Stay where you are but it hurts like help
And I'm sure it was fun at first
Test your pulse and check your vitals
If it's only a game, you lost me
I quit it with the suicidal recital

So now you know all my secrets
I want out, I know I don't need this!
I want friends who don't rank me on what I've been through
The more a battle scars, the more attention it gets you


Yea, we should've known it would end this way
What did you expect, pretend it all away?
And all we've got left is a sorry pile of hearts
I'm getting out, gonna write myself a new start
Come on, dry your eyes, meet me on the other side
Run as fast as you can and we'll make it out alive
We know better now, we don't have to live like this
Go and tell them all we don't have to live like this
I meant it when I said I wanna get well

If it's only a game, you lost me
I quit it with the suicidal recital4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I am standing on the edge of returning or just running away
I am letting myself look the other way
And the hardest part in all of this is
I don't think I know my way back home
Is it worth the journey, or do I let my heart settle here?

How cold have I become?
I  didn't want to
Lose you by what I'd done
Caught in the grey

I don't want to look you in the eyes, you might call me away
I don't want to give you the chance to make me stay
And the hardest part in all of this is
I know my way back, I don't want to go
And let you see, all that has become of me
I should've known, I should've known
I didn't have a chance

How cold have I become?
I didn't want to
Lose you by what I'd done
Caught in the grey
It burns for a moment but
But then it numbs you
Takes you and leaves you just
Caught in the grey
In your deepest pain
In your weakest hour
In your darkest night
You are lovely
(you tell me)
In your deepest pain
In your weakest hour
In your darkest night
You are lovely 
I am standing on the edge of returning or just running away4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
"What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?"

The scene is so sexist, believe me I get it, we'd probably sell more records if I flaunted my ass and chest but forget it
I work like one of the boys, and I'm as true as they get
But I'm a lady through and through, like give me some credit
I knew I'd regret it if I tried to blend in and pretend
Be something other than I am
Like have you noticed I'm a woman
Didn't come to downplay it, or to play it up either
And I'm not trying pick a fight or be nobody's leader
But it feels like everybody's just a little too interested
In the fact that females can indeed make music
Our interviews, our bios, - they all make it a point
"Female Fronted Band, from Decatur, Illinois"
And just once, I'd like to see some other band's resumé go out of their way to say they're fronted by a male, ok?
And while we're on it, let me say
Women don't all sound the same
Who gave us the idea that "Female Fronted” is a genre anyway?

Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
"What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?"
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?
And I know it's not fair, and I can't complain
Cuz with a girl in our band, people don’t look away
But you know what, it feels like they look just a little too long
Stare me up and down, forget to listen to the song
I take the stage and before I even open my mouth, the audience assumes that they got us all figured out
"Oh your band's got a chick, must be some kinda trick
There's no way she got this far without sucking somebody's..."
Did you really think that's how it works, I'm not fucking eye candy
I'm here to do my job, I'll be the last man standing
Boys in crowd asking, for me to flash them, well here you go, news flash:
You're ignorant and that's that
I bet you'd never say that to your little sister
The media's got you all jacked up, little mister
Cuz girls in my position can perpetuate the cycle
Walking a tightrope, don't know which way to go
Hypersexualize, or downplay your femininity
Dress like the dudes, or pray to God that you're pretty
Are you kidding me? And I don't even know who's to blame
Beauty sells, I buy it too, I'm trying to sell it back it you

Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
What's it like to be a girl, in the music world
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?
So tell me, what's a woman to do--no, scratch that
Tell me what's a human being to do with the fact that
What gets us ahead holds us back more
Isn't a level playing field too much to ask for?
And I know that by saying it, I'm bringing attention
To an issue that might be better left unmentioned -
But someone's gotta say it, gotta call out the scene
The scene is obscene, my sanity's split at the seams
So to all of ya'll making this just about ass and tits
Here to set the record straight, it don't gotta be this way
We can change the game, rearrange the way to fame
And make a bigger deal about the talent than the face
See I got little girls watching me, wanting to be like me
And I wanna show them that they don't gotta be like me
They can do their own thing, they can rewrite the rules
They can get respect without acting like fools
So let's not make it harder than it has to be
I'll keep making music, you stop asking me
"What's it like to be a girl in the entertainment world?"
Cuz now you know

Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
"What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?"
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?
Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know

 I'm sorry about your parents, they sound like bad people
Your daddy sounds like a jerk
I guess your mama didn't know the gift she got when she got you
I'm sorry about your life, you had it pretty rough
Bending over backwards, never good enough
You poor thing, it must suck to be you

And I know it's not your fault, it never is, is it?

I (I) know what it's like staying up all night nursing wounds
It takes (takes) more than I have, pick fights with the past, I always lose
Oh, don't you know? That's no way to live
I (I) know what it's like staying up all night nursing wounds

I get it, give me a little credit
I remember when I was that pathetic
Wear my scars on my sleeve, for all the world to see
Like look what they did to me quick, lay on the sympathy thick
You probably have the right to feel how you do
You were mistreated and cheated out of the childhood you needed
And now you'll never succeed if you're so convinced you're defeated
If you're obsessed with your yesterday then you're destined to repeat it
And I know it's not your fault, it never is, is it, is it, is it?

I (I) know what it's like staying up all night nursing wounds
It takes (takes) more than I have, pick fights with the past, I always lose
Oh, don't you know? That's no way to live

 I say I wanna be healthy, but I turn up the noise
The IV drips a steady stream of poison
I think I'm just in love with the feeling
Break my bones so I can feel them healing

"Crazy" is, I believe, the medical term
When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times
And gimme some more of that iodine

I can't make reality connect
I push till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?
I'll run in circles till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?

I say I wanna be happy, but I quickly forget
Will I sabotage all the good I've got left?
Depression's like a big fur coat
It's made of dead things but it keeps me warm
"Crazy" is, I believe, the medical term
When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times
And gimme some more of that iodine

I can't make reality connect
I push till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?
I'll run in circles till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?

I don't like pain, but I bring it to life
I don't like scars but I am good with a knife
I don't like tears when I'm starting to cry
And then I realize I'm destroying my life
I do this to myself
I do this to myself
Stop blaming someone else
We do this to ourselves
I can't make reality connect
I push till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?
I'll run in circles till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?

So if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these, why we still singin' these lullabies?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts? Happy hurts

This on again off again temperamental affection
For my darling depression is making me go mad
I hear there's a fine line between crazy and sad
But i can't tell a difference up close
There's a lot of us you know, ill and un-diagnosed
But i don't need a piece of paper to tell me what i already know
I'm not alright for tonight can we let that be alright?
Pick up the battle again in the morning light

And I'm fighting so hard to come out of the dark
Trying to turn off the night finally let in the light
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history
A little less victim a little more victory

Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind. Oh
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts? Happy hurts
So today i feel okay guess it was all just in my head
I just need to try harder i guess...
Yeah everyone else in the world seems to be doing alright
"Yeah i'm alright" for tonight  can we let the pain and the happy mix?
Can the two coexist? The beauty next to the mess
Because i swear i have them both already beating in my chest
If that makes me crazy the numbers don't lie
But i don't call that crazy i call that being alive

And I'm fighting so hard to come out of the dark
Trying to turn off the night finally let in the light
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history
A little less victim a little more victory please

Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind. Oh
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts? Happy hurts
[Bridge[
If i had to pick between the way that i am and the way that everybody else seems to pretend
I wouldn't consider it not for even a second between psycho and sanity it's not even a question
My favorite part of my self seems to make the least sense, all the cracks in my skin they just let the light in
My favorite part of my self seems to make the least sense
All the cracks in my skin let the light in
Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
All i want's the one thing i can't find
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?

 Misery, misery is the venom in my brain
Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain
Running from something that I can't really explain
Misery, misery is the venom in our veins

It's been kind of cold, feeling all alone
Haven't been myself in quite a while, you know
They got in my head, like everybody said
Cautionary tale, how quick the sick can spread

Don't meet their eyes, it's hypnotic
Make you forget that it's toxic
Caught up in all the chaotic
Sold you a lie and you bought it
Before you know it, you're nauseous
Hands down your throat 'til you vomit
Collapse from all the exhaustion
And now they got what they wanted

Misery, misery is the venom in my brain
Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain
Running from something that I can't really explain
Misery, misery is the venom in our veins
Na na na, na na na oh-oh

Show me where it hurts, I'll show you how it works
They prey on your fear of how it just gets worse
I can't tell if it's real, though, don't know if it's lethal
Did we drink the poison or just a placebo?

Don't meet their eyes, it's hypnotic
Make you forget that it's toxic
Caught up in all the chaotic
Sold you a lie and you bought it
Before you know it, you're nauseous
Hands down your throat 'til you vomit
Collapse from all the exhaustion
And now they got what they wanted

Misery, misery is the venom in my brain
Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain
Running from something that I can't really explain
Misery, misery is the venom in our veins

So watch your step or you're gonna fall apart
Hold yourself together inside the dark
Don't look down, you won't get far
You're only as strong as you think you are
Running from something that I can't really explain
Misery, misery is the venom in our veins4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low
Let me sink to the bottom
Air in my lungs keeping me afloat
Inside I'm still hollow

I know I'm not my thoughts
But my thoughts don't know that yet
Sometimes I try to sneak up
On the voice inside my head
I try to meditate, cause they told me it'll help
But the last thing I need is more time alone inside myself
I know I'm not unique, we all got broken brains
Culture recently decided being crazy is okay
And now we all can talk about it on our social feeds
Having a rough day?
Hashtag mental health awareness week
I know that's progress
We don't have to hide no more
But it leaves me wondering why we ain't said this stuff before
Like were we always all crazy and we all just kept quiet?
Are we on the same page with what we're identifying?
And if crazy's the new normal then it's not that crazy, is it?
Cause the word by definition means it sits outside the system
And how can we tell difference between sick and tryna' fit in?
And if everybody's crazy, then who's supposed to fix it?
I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low
Let me sink to the bottom
Air in my lungs keeping me afloat
Inside I'm still hollow

I don't wanna break down
So where do I go?
My screams sink to the bottom
Top of my lungs, just an echo
Inside I'm still hollow

No one told me it could get this bad, this fast
Guess we only hear about the struggle after it's passed
Getting easier to open up, share what we lost
Good to know I'm not alone
But if I'm really being honest
I kinda hope there's something wrong with me
I kind hope this isn't how it's supposed to be, supposed to be
I pray to god it's not normal
Crying on the floor
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low
Let me sink to the bottom
Air in my lungs keeping me afloat
Inside I'm still hollow

I don't wanna break down
So where do I go?
My screams sink to the bottom
Top of my lungs, just an echo
Inside I'm still hollow

I kinda hope there's something wrong with me
I kind hope this isn't how it's supposed to be, supposed to be
I pray to god it's not normal
Crying on the floor
I don't wanna do this anymore
I kinda hope there's something wrong with me
I kind hope this isn't how it's supposed to be, supposed to be
I pray to god it's not normal
Crying on the floor

I don't wanna break down

I don't wanna break down
But I'm feeling low
I don't wanna break down

I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low

Inside we're still hollow

I don't wanna break down
So where do I go?

 Oh I swear my emotions are the enemy
Be dead by now if I'd have done what they were telling me
Whisper lies but they sound like half-truth
Confusing a sick mind isn't that hard to do

You say I'm a hopeless case, I'm a hopeless case (Ohoho)
You say I'm a hopeless case, I'm a hopeless case (Oh)

I'm afraid I can't trust myself, myself
Don't leave me alone
How you want me to fix myself, myself
All I've ever known, I've ever known
How can I separate, me from the remedy?
I can't be sure, be sure
Am I the curse or the cure?

Oh it's more than a little maddening
Got me second-guessing everything that's happening
I think I think I'm in over my head
The more I think about it, the worse that it gets

All I see are all my flaws
I see it's all I'm not
I'm not senseless
I won't separate this heart to
Make it what you want
You can't tell me any more

Don’t it take it away
My sad makes me special

Do you want me to write you another sad song
Would you like that?
Do you want me tell you we’ll never belong
Would you like that?
Cuz the truth is we’re no different than the others
Wearing our sob stories like colors
The truth is we like it, we like it here
We’re better off than we let on I fear

Does it make you sick, the way that we live?
We say we’re over it but we-

Can’t undo the scars
All up and down our hearts
Can’t forget how it felt when it all fell apart
And we talk a big game like we wanna get well
In our prison made of pain
Only fooling ourselves
Oh I need my pain
Don’t it take it away
My sad makes me special

I want to scream my sick soul alive
I want to look you dead in the eyes
Did you think you were the only one? The only one? The only One?
We’re all holding on trying to make sense of
The insanity that we once loved
We’ve cut up our lives trying put down the knife
Trying to pick up the fight

Does it make you sick, the way that we live?

And dream a different ending
When I wake, I won't be so exhausted
And I'll stop with my pretending
That I'm fine, I'm fine if I can fool myself tonight
And my lie will drown out all of yours

I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take?
Just not enough to silence me
You're only a memory
I'll scream these words till they come true
Then I will think no more of you
Look back on what I'm going through
This isn't my identity

You will bleed for what your hands have done
You can't outrun your ending
And I'll get well long before you let yourself
I may forgive you but you never will

I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take?
Just not enough to silence me
You're only a memory
I'll scream these words till they come true
Then I will think no more of you
Look back on what I'm going through

And I told you, I told you, you had no right
How damaged you must be
Watch you panic, it's tragic, you'll carry this for life
You have my sympathy

I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take?
Just not enough to silence me
You’'e only a memory
I'll scream these words till they come true

We're not critics, we just hate it all anyway

If you're happy and you know it clap your hands like this
Cause the rest of us are wondering what on earth we missed
If you're happy and you know it stomp your feet real loud

We like our thrills dirt-cheap
And our irony thick
Oh, whatever, nevermind

Oh, tragic and miserable
We're not cynics, we just don't believe a word you say
We're not critics, we just hate it all anyway

Oh, we do what we've been taught
We're not cynics, we just don't believe a word you say
We're not critics, we just hate it all anyway
If you're happy and you know it
Then there might be something wrong with you
What's the point in holding on
When all of us don't want you to?
It'd make us feel better
Knowing you'd be stuck forever
Sick minds stick together
We can stay sick forever

Oh, this is all we know
Oh, tragic and miserable

 You and I go deep like water
You and I run red like blood
You know my darkest secrets
I know what you're made of
Drip drop, the rain is falling
I hear it all could flood
One rainy night away
From losing all you love

It's a brilliant game you play
When you lock yourself away and
You make me fight for you, you, you

I can't keep you above water
I can't drag your soul to shore
Don't know how to fix a sinking ship
Or win a losing war
It's a heavy load to carry
And I can't hold on much more
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm
I've so much more to tell you
We're running out of time
It's dark and dangerous
Treading oceans in your mind
Up all night I held your hand
While you wondered in the dark
You know I can't make you better
When all you want to be is lost

It's a brilliant game you play
When you lock yourself away and
You make me fight for you, you, you

I can't keep you above water
I can't drag your soul to shore
Don't know how to fix a sinking ship
Or win a losing war
It's a heavy load to carry
And I can't hold on much more
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm
I can't survive for both of us
I can't hold back the waves
This ocean isn't big enough for both of us
I'll let the water carry me away
I’ll let the water carry me away

I can't keep you above water
I can't drag your soul to shore
Don't know how to fix a sinking ship
Or win a losing war
It's a heavy load to carry
And I can't hold on much more
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm
(I'll let the water carry me down)
(I'll let the water carry me down)
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm

 My life is a musical
I know how to put on a pretty pathetic show
I hide backstage
Keep the curtains closed
'Cause I'm scared, I'm scared

I'm getting pretty good at feeding them the lines they like
But I don't recognize the girl that I face each night
I can compromise till I'm convinced
It's right

What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me

I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
"This is it!"
They say all the world's a stage
Rewriting your identity is all the rage
Well next act please, I'd like a change
I don't really like pretending
This way

What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me

I'm gonna burn this theater down and pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line
Like, "this is it!"
I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line
Like, "this is it!"

And the sad thing is we're all in on the action
We're all holding our breath, waiting for a reaction
You play your part
I'll be playing with matches
And if you'd like a show, you can follow the ashes
I'm gonna burn this theatre down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
"This is it!"
I'm gonna burn this theatre down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd

 Ashes, ashes, dust to dust
It doesn’t hurt enough yet, does it, does it?
(I’m gonna make you feel it
Gonna make you want it)
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
Half of you’s still underground
(I’m gonna make you feel it
Gonna make you want it.)
Don’t you want to feel something
In those heavy little veins of yours?
Clock’s ticking now, get your body off the floor
This is your addiction
So you can play the victim
But you can’t make me play along

Oh, fight back your demons
Don’t let them take you down, down
Oh, scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now, now

Ashes, ashes in the air
Remains of dead dreams everywhere
(I’m gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna make you want it)
Ashes, ashes, could be you
But you’re still beating, aren’t you?
(I’m gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna make you want it)
Aren’t you gonna do something with that pretty little heart of yours?
Get up, move, get your body off the floor
This world is twisted
It’s the human condition
But you don’t have to play along
Pain didn’t change me
I changed my pain
Pain didn’t change me
I changed my pain

Oh, fight back your demons
Don’t let them take you down, down
Oh, scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now, now

You didn’t come this far to just get this far

You didn’t come this far to just get this far
You didn’t shoot for the moon just to hit the stars
You didn’t work this hard just to fade to black
It cuts me in half to see you hold back
And you’ll know when you’re lost ‘cause I won’t let you sleep through the night
I won’t let you sleep through the night
I promise you I’ll be here screaming at you
Baby fight, baby fight, baby fight!
Oh, fight back your demons
Don’t let them take you down, down
Oh, scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now, now

Oh, fight back your demons

 I swear to God at night when I close my eyes
I can still see this little lost girl inside
And I don't know how to help her, I don't know what to do
Supposed to have this figured out but I'm so confused
For years I cried myself to sleep every night
Lived one day at a time, trying to just stay alive
And I knew people had it worse, but that didn't make me better
Took all I had inside just to hold myself together
But I knew I couldn't stop, kept hoping one day
Maybe I'd make it to a stage and tell you 'it's all okay.'
And that 'I love you. Even if I haven't met you yet
Hold on, stay strong and never forget.'

We've been lost, been to the bottom
Beaten up, torn and forgotten
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside
We've been burned, chained and depleted
Left alone, we're not defeated
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside

You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us
Everyday I felt a little less pain inside
But at that rate I knew I'd hurt until the day I died
I refused to let the darkness have the last say
So when it came to call my name, I had to run the other way
Maybe that's what it takes, you have to tell the pain no
Have to let the sick parts of your heart finally go
Make room for the light, let it pull you in close
And if you're ever feeling low, I think you know where to go

We've been lost, been to the bottom
Beaten up, torn and forgotten
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside
We've been burned, chained and depleted
Left alone, we're not defeated
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside

You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us

One day we're gonna wake up, we're gonna be alright
We'll look back and be happy that we kept ourselves alive
We'll honor where we came from, see what the hurt was for
But we don't let our past hold us hostage anymore
Cause we got more to give, more to live, more to be
More to who we are than our broken history
Like an army we all know it's not all better yet
But we hold on, stay strong, and never forget
You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us

We've been lost, been to the bottom
Beaten up, torn and forgotten
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside
We've been burned, chained and depleted
Left alone, we're not defeated
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside

You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us

 I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words
And blah, bla-blah, bla-blah, and I can sing until I'm dead
And none of you'll remember a single thing I've said

What's the point in being a voice
When everyone's already sick of the noise?
Everyone's already sick of the noise
Everyone's already sick of the noise
What's the point in trying to change
When everyone's already stuck in their ways
Everyone's happy with more of the same
More of the same, more of the same

We were born kicking and screaming
Till we learned to turn it down

Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die, fade on
And all along we got it wrong
Live a slow and painful life
Put our heart on hold inside, fade on
And all along we go it wrong
We keep it hush, hush, hush
Have you had enough?
Have you, have you had enough?
Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die, fade on
And all along we got it wrong
I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words

Oh I hate your static pace, you ask no questions, let things be
All you people never learn, and your heart gets on my nerves
And your heart gets on my nerves
And your heart gets on my nerves

We were born kicking and screaming
Till we learned to turn it down

Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die, fade on
And all along we got it wrong
Live a slow and painful life
Put our heart on hold inside, fade on
And all along we go it wrong
We keep it hush, hush, hush
Have you had enough?
Have you, have you had enough?
Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die, fade on
And all along we got it wrong
But no one listens, 'cause no one cares
If you're alive at all, let me see you stare
But no one listens, 'cause no one cares
If you're alive at all, let me see you stare
I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words
I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words

Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die, fade on

 The music is in my blood, you don't understand
The music is in my blood, you don't understand

Sleepless nights at the black and white keys
I'll let my fingers say it for me
Sometimes my spirit's still so scared
Once I put it in a melody it means so much more to me
Fate sealed, I guess this is how I feel
Sometimes I swear the lyrics write me
The lyrics write me

The melody, a remedy to calm me down
You never did approve of the fix I found

Bury all the records in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig them back up
You can bury my body in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig myself up
And I know all about the drugs they hide inside the music, I know, I know
I know all about the drugs they hide inside the music

And the preacher at church must've told you about them too
Cause you came home dead set on what you had to do
You said the demons and drugs hide in rock n roll thugs
If I wanna grow up nice, I better give the music up
The melody a remedy to keep me right
You never did approve of my sleepless nights

Bury all the records in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig them back up
You can bury my body in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig myself up
And I know all about the drugs they hide inside the music, I know, I know
I know all about the drugs they hide inside the music

Oh the words unwind, my hands rebel
I hide behind these notes too well
I can't pretend anymore
You're not listening, you don't understand
You're not listening, you don't understand
You're not listening, you don't understand
You're not listening, you don't understand

Bury all the records in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig them back up
You can bury my body in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig myself up
Bury all the records in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig them back up

Mistake me for pretentious
I get stuck in my head
It's not personal, it's just personal
I've been strong for too long
Sometimes I forget why I'm trying
I'm trying
I'm trying

I'm just a statistic
Just another tragic misfit
Ship that cliche to the clinic
Document my disposition
Then they put me in a box
Slap a label on the top
Tape me up and ship me off
Now I'm someone else's problem

They call me damaged
I let them think what they like
They call me difficult
'Cause I don't fit in the lines
But I didn't get this far without any scars
I'm not brittle
Well, maybe just a little
A little
I'm not brittle
Maybe just a little

If I get defensive
Don't say I'm oversensitive
Maybe I have a tendency to snap on people telling me
"You fit inside this box we built, we know you better than yourself"

People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
Lifetime of laughter, at the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die

 This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-woah-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my...

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells, and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

(Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-woah-oh)
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my...

Don't try and sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

(Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah, oh-oh)

 Cold open


Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I, I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?

If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
To be better than I could have ever been
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
I could be better, but, baby
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?

 I don't wanna hear you've got a boyfriend
Sometimes, you're better off alone
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't ever wanna be your boyfriend

And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)

Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright
I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous

And a black car that matches your blackest soul

Oh, the neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light

Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time

And a downtown storm with Aries rising

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should prob'ly introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough
(Don't think I'll ever get enough)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

It's a Helluva feeling though
It's a Helluva feeling though
Alright, alright
It's a Helluva feeling though

What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now
(Don't think I'll ever get it now)
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I've told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down when the sun came up
I think we've had enough

 Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s

 Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster, faster!

So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything

Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe
Just a dash of formaldehyde
And a habit of decomposing
Right before your very la-la-la-la eyes

Along with the people inside

Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
A wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah

And not to mention the constable
And his proposition for that “virgin”
Yes, the one the lawyer met with
On "strictly business", as he said to the Mrs
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of a different kind
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy

 Kids, you have to remember I'm up here conducting you for a reason, okay? Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me. One and, two and, three and, ready, go!

Dès le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants, j'aimerais être comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour, je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...

My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody, my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a

Matching set of marching clocks
The slumbering apparitions that they've come to wake up

Here I am composing a burlesque
Out of where they rest their necks
Sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a girl

You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence, and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (I've got just one...)

 She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Mona Lisa, wear me out
I'm pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa, wear me out

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right

 If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page, it's chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)

Sugarcane in the easy morning
(Hey moon, please forget to fall down)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Hey moon, don't you go down)
Sugarcane in the easy morning
(You are at the top of my lungs)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Drawn to the ones who never yawn)

 Ode to the old, and to the new
We rededicate this song to you

Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
One more, one more

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Say it one more, one more, one more

Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
One more, one more

We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Quick charade, Beyoncé, Lemonade
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
No delay, no halfway, let me hear you say
One more, one more, one more
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top

 Ohh!
A moment you'll never remember
And a night you'll never forget!
Ohh!

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let it move right through ya (Hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (Over it)
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let it move right through ya (Hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

I was drunk and it didn’t mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (Over it ohhhhh)

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I’m sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You’ll never know if you don’t ever try again
So let’s try, let’s try, let’s try
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let it move right through ya (Hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let it move right through ya (Hallelujah!)

She said, "At night, in my dreams
You dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh, but when I wake up
You're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight like commuters
With briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer
Inside of your eyes"

But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson"
Said, "You're just like Mike Love

How the wine plays tricks on my tongue
But you don't seem to change
When you stuff all of your feelings with drugs"
Other boys you may have dated
Serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts
Baby, it's a sweet butter knife

She said, "You're just like Mike Love

Said, "You're just like Mike Love

 Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place, in your house of memories

Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I think of you from time to time more than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters, I was a fool
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
Then will you remember me in the same way as I remember you?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place

 Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good
Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place where we used to say
"Man, it feels good to feel this way"
Now I know what I mean
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do

 Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you
Anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching
You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take

Burn everything you love then burn the ashes

 She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "No one should ever feel like..."

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ)

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake, and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love)

 I think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm 'bout to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision, so stuck, night vision
But I come to life, come to life

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah

Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, real living, fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?

 Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before

 Put on your war paint

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Put on your war paint

The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love

Gonna say something that would solve all our problems
But then I got drunk and I forgot what I was talking about
I forgot what I was talking about
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody but you
Than to be loved by everybody but you, but you

If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see
Any of you again, never see any of you again

I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number, but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Woke up on the wrong side of p-p-paradise
And when I say I'm sorry I'm late
I wasn't showing up at all
I really mean I didn't plan on showing up at all
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended with you
I miss the days when I pretended with you, with you

If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see

I think I'd be a medicine man
So I could get high on our own
Supply whenever I can
And I became such a strange shape
Such a strange shape from trying to fit in
I became such a strange shape
Such a strange shape

I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder

I never really feel a thing, I'm just kinda too froze
You were the only one, that even kinda came close
I just pinch myself, no longer comatose
I woke up, no luck, I woke up, no luck

And when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
I got too high again, realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend, I love you to death, but I just can't
I just can't pretend, we were lovers first
Confidants but never friends, were we ever friends?

But when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you

The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife

And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist singing

Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

Young and a menace

Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived

Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace
Young and a menace

I’m just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... For the...
Fall!

 Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah

 I am an arms dealer fitting you with
Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate

I wrote the gospel on giving up
(You're looking pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk
(Prima donnas of the gutter)
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

Bandwagon's full, please catch another

I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate

Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoo!


All the boys who the dance floor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Now you!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Wear out the groove!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Sing out loud!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race (Oh, oh!)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race!
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Fall Out Boy, 
 I thought of angels choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water (Water)
See how dirty I can get them pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings (Clip their tiny wings)

Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name

If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday

Letting people down is my thing, baby, find yourself a new gig
This town ain’t big enough for two of us
I don’t have the right name or the right looks (Right looks)
But I have twice the heart
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name (Name)

If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday

If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same way
And now I’m here to give you all of my love (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So I can watch your face as I take it all away (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)

Artist:Fall Out Boy, 
 One look from you and I'm on that faded love
Out of my body and flying above
If there were any more left of me, I'd give it to you
And I'll tell you that I am fine, but I'm a missile that's guided to you

Go out in the world to start over again and again
As many times as ya can
And in the end, if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Would you give me, give me, give me

Give me a boost, a boost over heaven's gate, yeah
Give me a boost over heaven's gate, I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate

I got dreams of my own, but I want to make yours come true
So please come through, honey please, please come through

Oh, go out in the world, start over again and again
As many times as you can
And in the end, if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Give me a boost, a boost over heaven's gate, yeah
Give me a boost over heaven's gate, I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate

You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit I just can't kick

You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one, you're the one

 You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July71EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Fall Out Boy, 
 I'm coming apart at the seams
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams
Now buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was

Fell out of bed, butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry
Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man
He needs his head put through a CAT scan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable

Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half-doomed, and you're semi-sweet

So boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy, ohh...)
Little girl, got me staring odd
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
P-p-painted dolls in the highway, truck stop stalls
Lot lizards scales cool my nightlife moods
All the rookies, leave your badge and your gun on the desk
When you leave the room

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half-doomed, and you're semi-sweet

Boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)

(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
So boycott love, boycott love...
(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
Boycott love, boycott love...
(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
So boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy

 Artist:Deep Purple, 
 We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

Artist:Deep Purple, 
 I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me and love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here
Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Yes, I can hear the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Oh-oh-oh
And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Oh, oh-oh-oh
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

Ah, ah, ah, no
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh
Is aching with the dead of the night
Oh-uh-oh, precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

Oh, oh-oh

Past midnight I still see the land
People are saying the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reaching higher
We were fools, we called her a liar
All I hear is
"Burn!"

I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm
She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn"
"When I leave there's no return"
The people laughed till she said, "Burn!"
Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shaking, we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared
Still I hear
"Burn!"

You know we had no time
We could not even try
You know we had no time


You know we had no time

Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead
I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale


Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time
But it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason
For the things we had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man

 There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, "I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn?"

I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman

She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
"Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star"
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman
Ooh my soul, I love you


She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died


Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Superstar
Who do we think we are?
Oh my soul, I love you baby1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high
She came on like a teaser
I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The log was in my pocket
When Lucy met the rocket
She never knew the reason why
I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh, it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase
Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
It's not against the law
The point of no return
Now you know the score
And now you're learning
Ah-ha, what's knockin' at your back door
Sweet Nancy was so fancy
To get into her pants
We had to be the aristocracy
The members that she toyed with
At her city club
Were something in diplomacy
So we put her on the hit list
Of a common cunning linguist
A master of many tongues
Now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley
Suddenly she feels so young
I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh, it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase
Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
No, it's not against the law
The point of no return

But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai

With that smile on my face, oh-oh-oh

 Oh yeah, I see the way you roll your eyes
The way your purse your lips
Throw your stuff into a suitcase
Put your hands upon your hips

The way you toss your head
You make stupid accusations
By which time I've lost the thread
Sometimes I wonder how it is you get
To piss me off this much
I may be heavy-handed
And I lack the tender touch
You moan and groan about me staying out
And drinking with the guys
How 'bout I bring them home?
Try that one on for size
There's something awfully wrong with this deal, babe
Any fool could see it's true
Can't you understand how I feel, babe?
You've got me
But all I got is you
I guess I just don't have it in me
To keep you satisfied
To be honest with you, babe
I'm only in it for the ride
And you may never bring yourself
To take me as I am
But in case you haven't noticed
I don't give a fucking damn!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You don't want to live, don't want to cry no more


Well, my crying ain't done no good
I said, my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort, no, not like you should

Lazy!
You just stay in bed
Lazy!
You just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread

 Black night is not right
I don't feel so bright
I don't care to sit tight

Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home

I don't need a dark tree
I don't want a rough sea
I can't feel, I can't see

Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home

Black night, black night
I don't need black night
I can't see dark light

Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me

 Good Golly said little Miss Molly
When she was rocking in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty
When she was rocking to the east and west

Lucille was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on baby drive me crazy do it do it

I'm a speed king
You got to hear me sing
I'm a speed king
See me fly

Saturday night and I just got paid
Going to fool about isn't going to save
Some people going to rock some people gonna roll
Going to have a party to save my soul
Hard headed woman and a soft hearted man
They been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice take a little beans
Going to rock and roll down to New Orleans



Some people going to rock some people going to roll
Going to have a party to save my soul

 Coming out of nowhere
Driving like rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
Because it's coming your way

Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's going to make you bleed
And you know he's gonna get you

Rainbow shaker
On a stallion twister
Bareback rider
On the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down
Meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning
Heading your way
Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's going to make you bleed

 The golden light above you shows me where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon
You stand up on your hill they bebop all around you
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah
They wonder where I found you

Oh, my love, it's a long way
Where you're from it's a long way

I tried to understand you, tried to love you right
The way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight
Your lips are like a fire burning through my soul
And people ask me where you're from
They really wanna know

Oh, my soul, it's a long way
Where you're from it's a long way

Magic woman wrecking up my soul
Things you tell me have never been told
Magic woman I don't know
Electric before me I love you so I love you so
You're racing like a fireball dancing like a ghost
You're Gemini and I don't know which one I like the most
My head is getting broken and
My mind is getting bust
But now I'm coming with you down the road of golden dust

 Creeping round my door, I got a big surprise
Couldn't see a thing but open skies

They've taken her away
Where is she now?

Wish that she was here, I wish she'd hold my hand
Maybe she would laugh, maybe understand

Why was I so cruel?
Where is she now?

Acting like a fool, I had to make her cry
Maybe I'm a Leo but I ain't a lion

 Somebody's shouting
Up at a mountain
Only my own words return
Nobody's up there
It's a deception
When will I ever learn?

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

Wondering blindly
How can they find me?
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking
Anticipating
The call of the black-hooded crow

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And taunting with pictures of home

Here in this prison
Of my own making
Year after day, I have grown
Into a hero
But there's no worship
Where have they hidden my throne?

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And screaming out pictures of home

 It wasn't quite the curse of Tutankhamen
Or the kiss of death from Judas in the night
And it felt so far beyond the blue horizon
Tempting me with transports of delight
And then the devil took my hand and said
Come along with me
Oh, there I was, wide awake and dreaming
Reaching out for something in the sky
But I could not control that trembling feeling
Everything I want is slipping by
Oh, and the devil took my hand and said
Something you should see (Come along with me)
(Come along with me)
I never knew what happened to my nightmare
Everything went dark that August day
And the eclipse was on the other side of somewhere
But I was on the upside of afraid
And then an angel took my hand and said
Come along with me (Come along with me)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 While you were out
The message says
You left a number
And I tried to call
But they wrote it down
In a perfect Spanish scrawl 

Yet again
I'm missing you
King size bed
(in a) hotel someplace
I hear your name
I see your face 

(The) back street dolls
And the side door johnnies
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of
Money
Back in the alley
Going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail
Of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be
So high I know
If the times gone by
Hadn't been so low
The best laid plans
Come apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams
Sometimes I feel like
Screaming
Close my eyes
It's times like this
My head goes down
And the only thing I know
Is the name of this town 

Yet again
I'm missing you
Won't be long
O' coming home
Until that distant time
I'll be moving on

 Got a black breast Chinese eyes
Got an English brain that's going to make me wise
Got a long story that I want to tell
To a rhythm that I know so well

Really got a lot of loving that I want to give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I got to live
I tried another but she didn't want to know

Take a hold now if you can
Take a lesson from a hard loving man
I'm a long way from where I want to go
Guess I'll stay awhile I really love you so
How's about another sip of all the wine you got
Take a tip from me and give it here I'll drink the lot
I'm not a whiny I'm a putting on a show
You really grab me but I've got to move
Before they know I'm here and spread the news
Maybe in a while when I've moved around
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds

 I stood under your bedroom window
Throwing up a brick
No one came I threw one more
That really did the trick
Your daddy came and banged my head
He said what kind of man
Is this that's hanging 'round my girl
And threw me in the cab

You're a farmer's daughter
You're a farmer's daughter
Why do I always get
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get
I won't get no more eggs and water
Now I've laid the farmer's daughter

Imagine I was a full-grown man
And I could talk just right
Could I came and see you here
And do this every night
Wham! The door comes crashing down
Your daddy's face all pale
Says come with me you hairy bum
I'll put you in my jail
You're a judge's daughter
You're a judge's daughter
Why do I always get
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get
Now I'm getting jail and torture
Cos' I made the judge's daughter
Yes, I did
It was nice

It seems they're screaming law and order
When I go with anyone's daughter

Woman I should like some peace
And daddy hold your tongue
I think you're gonna die of fright
When I tell you what I've done
I can hear your tales and lies
You say I'm dumb and scraggy
But man this dumb and scraggy is
Your daughter's baby's daddy

She's a lucky daughter
Such a lucky daughter
Why did I always get
The kinda girl I didn't wanna get
Now I've got what I always fought for
Cos I've married a rich man's daughter

 I'm talking to myself again
And waving to a passing friend
I've know her since I don't know when
Ah, it's nothing at all
Just the few of us walk arm in arm
It's innocent and charming
But the children seem to be getting alarmed
Don't worry kids, it's nothing at all

When I hear about the doom and gloom
That's around the corner and coming soon
I take a sip of mother's ruin
And sit with my back to the wall

It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
And the old lady smiled
It's nothing at all
Then she blew all the leaves off my tree

And the junk that sails our seven seas
Is very nearly up to my knees
But the platitudes and pleasantries
Keep saying it's nothing at all
I'll deal with it on another day
If I close my eyes it'll go away
So bottoms up, boys, and what do you say?
Really, it's nothing at all

It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
And the old lady smiled
It's nothing at all
And the summer passed away

Nothing at all
It's nothing at all
And the old lady smiled
It was nothing at all
Then she blew all the leaves off my tree

Long lost is the wishing well

Pray for us on the wild side?

Tragic life on the wild side

Do you ever seem to have one of those days
Where everyone's on your case
From your teacher all the way down
From, well, to your best girlfriend?
Well, I used to have those about all the time
Until I found a way to get out of it
Let me tell you about!

I'm sitting in the classroom thinking it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap, it just isn't my bag
When two bells ring, you know it's my cue
I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two

Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school

Checking out the halls, making sure the coast is clear
Looking in the stalls, nah, there ain't nobody here
My buddies, Sixx, Mick, and Tom
To get caught would surely be the death of us all
Smoking in the boys room
I was smoking in the boys room
Now teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school
Hey, can I be excused?


Well, put me to work in the school book store
Check-out counter and I got bored
The teacher was looking for me all around
Two hours later, you know where I was found

Smoking in the boys room
I tell you I was smoking in the boys room
Now teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school

Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
I tell you, I was smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Hey teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school
One more!
Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Hey, teacher, I ain't fooling around with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking ain’t allowed in school1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Filipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys, you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to "Sin"
I guess that's the name of her game
Yeah, I really used to love her
Then, the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing

Now all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain

I say no, no, no
No, no, no

Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet farewell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells
Well, all around the world

 Don't you know, know, know
It's a violation
I still hear you saying
Such a perfect, perfect night
No, no, no, fight all temptation
Well, in a black-hearted alley fight
I'm screaming. "Take me to the heights tonight"

Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top

Too many times
Victim accusation
No, you don't have to take it like that
A sheer, sheer heart attack
No, no, no, no realization
Well, I never had a way with you
But I still hear you saying
Take me to the top

 Frankie died just the other night
Some say it was suicide
But we know
How the story goes
With his six string knife
And his street-wise pride
The boy was a man before his time
And she knew
All their dreams would come true
But ya see, Frankie was fast
He was too fast to know
He wouldn't go slow
Until his lethal dose
And she knows
He'll finally come too close

Well, on with the show
Going on with the show
Come on baby
No, no, no
Oh my, my, my
My, my, oh my
Well, on with the show
Going on with the show
Come on baby
No, no, no
Oh my, my, my
My, my, oh my
He was bad, he was never good
But one thing that he understood
And she knew
All those lies would come true
The time has come and he's paid his dues
Suzy finally got the news
She always knew
This day would come soon

Going on with the show

He was stopped on a dime with a switchblade knife
Some damn punk went and took Frankie's life
And she knew
She'd have to pull through
Broken down, with his broken dreams
With a wink of an eye, said Suzy, "Listen to me"
You must go on with the show

 Here I come, my mind is set
Get ready for love
You're my ten second pet
Touch my gun but don't pull my trigger
Let's make history in the elevator
Or lock the door
Shine my pistol some more
Here I come, just ten seconds more

Ten seconds to love 
Pull my trigger
My guns loaded with your love
Ten seconds to love 
Just wait honey
Until I tell the boys about you

Bring a girlfriend
Maybe bring two I got my camera
Make a star outta you
Let's inject it
Photograph it
Down to the subway
Let the boys have it

Reach down low
Slide it in real slow
I wanna hear your engine roar
Before I'm in the door
You feel so good
Do you want some more
I got one more shot
My guns still warm


Was it hot for you
Did you fire this round
The second I'm through
I'll be leaving this townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 The blade of my knife
Faced away from your heart
Those last few nights
It turned and sliced you apart
This love that I tell
Now feels lonely as hell
From this padded prison cell
So many times I said
You'd only be mine
I gave my blood and my tears
And loved you, cyanide
When you took my lips
I took your breath
Sometimes love's better off dead

You're all I need
Make you only mine
(I loved you)
So I set you free
I had to take your life
(You're all I need)
You're all I need
You're all I need
And I loved you so
But you didn't love me
Laid out cold
Now we're both alone
But killing you
Helped me keep you home
I guess it was bad
Cause love can be sad
But we finally made the news
Tied up smiling
I thought you were happy
Never opened your eyes
I thought you were napping
Well, I got so much to learn
About love in this world
But we finally made the news

You're all I need
Make you only mine
(I loved you)
So I set you free
I had to take your life
(You're all I need)
You're all I need
You're all I need
And I loved you so
So I put you to sleep
You're all I need
Make you only mine

 Without you, there's no change
My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space

To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain

I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, that's okay
Let's turn the page
My friends called today
Down from L.A
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away
That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page

And it goes this way

Girl, just go away
Girl, don't go away mad

 I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Just don't leave
Don't leave

I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

Just don't leave
Don't leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave

Trapped in your hot car

Lying in the reeds

Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others

 Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high

Taking off and landing

Disappointed people clinging on to bottles

Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless

Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason

 Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinity

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour

Deaf, dumb, and blind

I won't turn around or the penny drops
Won't stop now, won't slack off

Where all this love has been in vain

Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet (Shot of baby strapped in back seat)

Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring

Come back in focus again
The walls abandon shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice
Wish away the nightmare

I tried to change the game, I tried to infiltrate but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble

I'll show you a god falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time, or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right

 It's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah, I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out

'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now, I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out, escaping now

 Dead inside
(Dead inside)
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me, babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died, long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside


You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside
(Dead inside)

Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting, babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything, I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside

For all my life, I've been pursued
You'd be afraid if you could feel my pain
And if you could see the things I am able to see

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

I hail from the dark side
For all my life, I've been besieged
You'd be scared living with my despair
And if you could feel the things I am able to feel

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee

 Is our secret safe tonight?
And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?

It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm

Hopeless time to roam

Fades away to nowhere

You have only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches of the state
You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands

Arm yourself
You can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire
Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy
Now you finally have the code
I have given you the code

Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were
There’s no countries left
To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It’s human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive alone
With no one left to love
Ah ah ah ah...

Lost in space and time forevermore

Come out of the shade
Let's burn all the money, absolve all the lies
And wake up unscathed

Replaced with visions of you
Now life can begin, I've cleansed all my sins

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

 I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had

She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
An' when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

 I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)
(Or just mine tonight?)212EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high?"
And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?"214EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain’t it funny what you’ll do?
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat

 So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah

The look of love, the rush of blood
The "She's with me"s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the color dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem

 Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)

Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five

 I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, "Long Hot Summer"
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?

 Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

Good afternoon

And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

 Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just post-mix lemonade

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go, go, go, go

 I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Cast patterns on the ceiling

I thought it was dark outside

One for the road

And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

 Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning


Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called

 They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the Top 100 list

And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says that "We are defenders of any poser
Or professional pretender around"

And when did your list replace the twist and turn
Like a fist replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the teddy picker

 I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately


I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
And didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just tryna orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was
Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart

And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold
Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind59EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty seat
A flash of light
It will take a while
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I'm on your side
You wide-eyed girls
You get it right

Fall back into place
Fall back into place

Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart?
What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost?
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes
Fall back into place

 Drifting in and out, you see the road you're on
It came rolling down your cheek, you say just what you mean
And in between it's never as it seems

Help me to name it

If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
What comes after this, momentary bliss?
The consequence of what you do to me

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows falling from the sun
Canyon calling, would they come to greet you?
Let you know you're not the only one

Can't keep hangin' on to what is dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
Materialize or let the ashes fly

 Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
And I asked, "Are you ready
Ready for this life?"

Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well
Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, so well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want me to
You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
(When the train comes I will hold you)
Cause you blow my mind
On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you)
There is no right time

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get over it

There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you (Were you high)
When they knocked on the door looking for you…
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)

 You always go to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees
I would not beg you, please
I want your picture but not your words
You know they’d want it, but there's no first
On your own
But you cannot call it your home
We always rub our hands too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your own bone
We run our fingers together
You know it's easy
The devil's plan
On your own
You cannot call me your own
Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause I'm not having fun
You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
You cannot; You are not for free15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Stand beside it, we can't hide the way you make us glow
It's no good unless it grows
Feel this burning, love of mine
Deep inside the ever spinning
Tell me, does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning 'til we're running from it

I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

You say swimming in the lake, we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake
Feel its heartbeat, feel what you heat
Far so fast, it feels too late

I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true

The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals
From the rose that's in your mouth
Beyond love
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands
Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
All I know's what I see
No change in this
Visions born in the dreams
Of a world left without it
We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know
The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there, a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light
We really wanna know

Could you ever believe beyond love?

It's a quick turn to let us in

Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark

Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up

It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again

This game I play

Then promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

This pulls me through

You see through me
Still, it's coming back

 Can't help seeking corners
Of dark and dead-end rooms
Where the drinks keep pouring down
And the candles keep me warm
Isolation tenders
Something fragile coming soon
Skinny angels making eyes at cameras
Perched in every room

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
Memory's a sacred meat
That's drying all the time
On a hillside, I remember
I am loving losing life

Strawberries in springtime
Pretty happy accidents
My awareness that I'm lucky
Rolling clouds over cement
Maybe there's a screenplay
Or a bathroom I can hide
Down the hallways of a high school
And the dances left behind
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
I would climb the Eiffel Tower
Write letters on the sky
How many turns it took to reach you

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
On a hillside, I remember
I am loving losing life6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Our bodies stopped the spirit living
Wouldn't you like to know
How far you’ve got left to go?
Somebody’s child, nobody made you
It’s not what you stole, it's what they gave you
In or out, you go
In your silence, your soul

Would you rather go unwilling?
The heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left

In hind of sight, no peace of mind
You begin and I’m defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell in spite of me
In hind of sight, no peace of mind
It begins and we're defined

 Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl85EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's going to save a little warmth for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

If I'm born again
I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace
But who's gonna say a little grace for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?
See the sun go down
It's going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light
But who's gonna save a little light for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

 Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

Take your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 A gardener told me some plants move
But I could not believe it
'Til me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix

A man of faith said hidden eyes
Could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through Waverly and Lincoln

Our days were long, our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
"I miss those freezing beaches"
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces
If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time40EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters runnin' 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go it alone on your own for a bit

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense

 Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn't love You
And Babylon don't love You
But You love everything
Oh, You saint
America don't love You
So I could never love You
In spite of everything

In the dark of this place
There's the glow of Your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go

The zealous hearts don't love You

All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel

Outside the tents
On the festival grounds
As the air began to cool
And the sun went down

Into "19th Nervous Breakdown"

 We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time for their great surrender
But they don't remember

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's
Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'Cause I still remember
Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

 Bend my finger back, snap! Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

Bless me with a heart attack, a real crise cardiaque
And show me where to find the surgeon’s knife
Eviscerate me now, hack! Take me to my punishment
The punishment I needed all my life
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on with strife
Listen to my bum rap, listen to the evidence
Exonerating me from being right
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

You know that I’ve been wicked and the road to hell is wide
Cursed by curiosity that made us go inside
Everyone was charming but we took 'em for a ride
Baby, you’re not anybody’s fool

Bend my finger back, snap! Pack it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool
The harpsichord is broken and the television's fried
The city's getting hotter like a country in decline
Everyone's a coward when you look them in the eyes
But baby, you're not anybody's fool

Sing "Next Year in Jerusalem"
You know, the one at 103rd and Broadway?
'Cause this Orthodox girl fell in love
With the guy at the falafel shop
And why not? Should she have averted her eyes
And just stared at the laminated poster of the Dome of the Rock?

And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood

Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Condolences to gentle hearts who couldn’t bear to try
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die

 Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!

His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

 It's not right, but it's now or never
And if I wait, could I ever forgive myself?
On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light from the TVs buzzing in the house

'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet

'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I know, you'll say I'm not doing it right
But this is how I want it
I can't go back to how I felt before
There's–

That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81


Looking out at the ice cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car, all black with diplomatic plates18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 One look sent knees to the ground
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound
So hold me close, my baby

Don't lie, I want him to know
God's loves die young; is he ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

Young turks, young Saturday nights
Young hips shouldn't break on the ice
Old flames, they can't warm you tonight
So keep it cool, my baby

Don't lie, I want him to know
Dial up, three rings and return him his gold
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And everyone I know

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
God's love die young, are you ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Cause the fire can't last and the winter's cold

 In December, drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

In December, drinking horchata
Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

You'd remember drinking horchata
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh, you had it but oh, no, you lost it
Looking back, you shouldn't have fought it
In December, drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Are falling down and nearing the rosebeds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh, you had it but oh, no, you lost it
You understood so you shouldn't have fought it
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Vampire Weekend, 
 I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even with our oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right

I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra

My revolution thoughts
Your little arrows of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire
But it's not useful now
Since we've both made up our minds
You're going to watch out for yourself
And so will I
I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried

You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You're not a contra
You wanted rock and roll, complete control
Well, I don't know

Never pick sides
Never choose between two
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you
You said, "Never pick sides
Never choose between two"
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you

I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra

 I know the reason why you think you gotta leave
Promises of future glory don't make a case for me
I did my best and all the rest is hidden by the clouds
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now

Leaving on your wedding day, all calm and dressed in white
All I'll keep's the memory of one last crooked night
The pews are getting filled up, the organ's playing loud
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now
Alright

God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Mbae mi givim evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

I know the reason why you think I oughta stay
Funny how you're telling me on my wedding day
Crying in those rumpled sheets like someone's 'bout to die
You just watch your mouth when talking 'bout the father of the bride

Why's your heart grown heavy, boy, when things were feeling light?
Turning this June morning into some dark judgment night
This ain't the end of nothing much, it's just another round
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now
God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Mbae mi givim evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

 I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, lead me to myself

Oh, I was made to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Oh, I was born to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand

Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath a chandelier
That’s going down

I thought it over and drew the curtain
Lead me to my cell, lead me to my cell
I hummed the Dies Irae as you played the Hallelujah
Lead me to my cell, don't leave me in my cell

If you’d been made to serve a master
You'd be frightened by the open hand, frightened by the hand
Could I have been made to serve a master?
Well, I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait

Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know

Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me

 Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

When I was seventeen, I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete
And now my body fades behind a brass charade
And I'm obsolete
But if the chance remained to see those better days
I'd cut the cannons down
My ears are blown to bits from all the rifle hits
But still I crave that sound

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun
I heard you play guitar down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight
Your Tokugawa smile and your garbage style
Used to save the night
You felt the coming wave, told me we'd all be brave
You said you wouldn't flinch
But in the years that passed, since I saw you last
You haven't moved an inch

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
(I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on)
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun

 Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white

The city was freezing, an elegant floe
The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold
You walked to the bedroom and sat down to write
The page in your notebook was unbearably white

There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

Sooner or later, the story gets told
To tell it myself would be unbearably bold
Presented with darkness, we turn to the light
Could've been smart, we're just unbearably bright
There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white

Baby, I love you, but that's not enough

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track

Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Come streaming back

 I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

(Uh)
(Mmmmm)

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, "Taxi"
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(Here we go again)
That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away

Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away
(Oh, what they say)
Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away
Bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes, you can, like "Can I Kick It?" Wicked
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope Diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit
(Zzzt!) A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beats got family members askin' him for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em, "Clean it"
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said, "Nah, fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?"

 Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

Shoot it true, I want you in the picture

(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

 If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (She's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover
(She's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar
Nothing to be justified yet
She the first I'm running with
She the one that get my collar
She the one I'm running with

She's the one I'm running with

I'm yellow, he was blue
It's nothing that he could hide
We made a green meadow
Whenever we would collide
She's my collar
I died a thousand times
I did what I had to do
Hey, that's just how it goes
I'm still coming back to you

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her

'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her

 I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people who are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance


I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people who are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance
In my backpack, I got my act right in case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken
With anger and discontent some are seeking
In search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box, six under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder
With lightning-fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
"The war is over", so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance
I need a gun to keep myself among70EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Momentary bliss

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)
"What was scripted, the day before it happened?"
We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out it did your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But mining for metal gave you platinum
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

Poster boy (Ayy)
Poster girl (Rita)
In truth, the bills (The bills)
Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Poster boy (Yeah, alright)
Poster girl (Ah, that's time)

In truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left is sodden cake, typical
Oh, you need to change your face
You're getting sold, it's such a waste
Y'know, we could do so much better than this
Swimming in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it
Meanwhile, you keep on adding
How big you gonna grow?
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink

 I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
The shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say "I'm leaving" to you
You've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
You're soft

You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

I’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
I’m at Lay Chimirida, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just kicked down, I love when I’m seen
Yeah, and if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
You get a heart, break
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

New word, onomatopoeia (Boom)
Quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad cause the winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duked, gotta get duked, the duke
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about
"Ah, he don't rap enough"
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like "Wrap it up, hoe"
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfuckin' momma
Bet you still stay with your motherfuckin' momma
Keep sleeping on me, I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come Blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all this
Fly shit, I stay finna take off
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing

Bet it up, head erupts
A lava language in a vocal volcanic
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush
Man, they sound like, man, they stole your
Man, they look like—nope, it ain't us

When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself in Cupid's lake
Chipped in your head
Do you indicate to satellites
Passing by the edge?

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in

Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

And if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
Fall through space out of mind with me

Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet, working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar?

Soon, like a wave, empires will fall
And closing in on you, they're going on

When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe?
Through the lithium
Busted and blue

I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
So amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds I went

All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light

The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body

Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)
If it's love, it's electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above
All recession, if I know your heart
Electric is the love
There's only one way (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Let it play a little while longer (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
It's got a way of passing through man and woman (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
In another world, in another world, in a universe, oh! (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Right now, here's what we've got to do

If it's love, it's electric (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
It'll be flowing on the streets (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Night after night (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout...
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Right now!36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uh-ah

You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man livin' in a levelled world
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

You can call me crack, you can call me glad and cyborg
You can load my head, and send me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lime pit
You can boil my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

Stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out
Stressin' out, stressin' out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out
Don't stress it out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out
Stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out
Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tales?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke, nah
The joke's to try to find the answer to nope (Uh)
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark through my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

(I'm a mad Pac-Man) Suu
(Livin' in a levelled world)

Yo, I been at the top of the top, fell from the ceiling before, I fell
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, with the glow, uh
Walk on the edge, fuck trying to dream in the bed
‘Fore I die on these meds, nigga gon' die in the feds
‘Fore I make it to jail, I'll probably put one in the head
Fuck the judge and prosecutor for hanging me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I’m closer to live, right? Closer to live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the rear lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the black knight
Keep a peace like Buddas, got the whole hood boomin'
I’m like a Crip high student, you on your ass, stuck stupid
You makin' weed look bad, I'll ride the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cop's lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last, every food crumb in it
I had to change my image, the brain don't got limits
You think a mil’ mean winning, pigs out here skinning
His soul ain't authentic, you died and still ain’t livin'18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I wish I could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

And we can find new ways of living
Make playing only logical harm
And we can top the old times

It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart
She packs it away

Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah, maybe to the beach
When your friends, they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
He speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
By the long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah, you come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh, heaven restores you in life
I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semi-erotic
You need someone to take you there

Why can't we just play the other game?

Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into
My airspace

 She says it helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow is like braille to the night
She swears I’m a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care?

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate

She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves
But she doesn’t know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I’m just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
All the people that you’ve loved, they’re all bound to leave some keepsakes
I’ve been swinging all the time, think it’s time I learned your way
I picture you and me together in the jungle, it would be ok

I’ll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don’t sleep tonight
It’s like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don’t bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It’s like learning a new language
You come here to me
We’ll collect those lonely parts and set them down
You come here to me

She keeps on waiting for time out there
Oh, love, can you love me, babe?
Love, is this loving, babe?
Is time turning around?

We slips into the bedroom
Babe, you know me, this is alright
Holdings we'll make soon
Will sustain us through the night
Inside my bedroom, baby
Touch me, oh, tonight
Poses, we'll make some
Will reveal our sense of right

You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You could be in my space2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I'm timeless like a broken watch
I make money like Fred Astaire
I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time
Your pretense is not what restricts me
It's the circles inside
The anatomy of kisses and a teacher who tries
Who knows how we'll disappear?
Would you like to be my missus and in future with child?
You know we can't get back from here
But we can get away

Baby, don't you try to find me
Baby, don't you try to fight
Baby, don't you try to find me
Baby, it will be alright

Along the way, tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
We sail today, tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life
I am the scavenger between the sheets of union
Lately, I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone
I am the scavenger between the sheets of union

Lady, don't you try to find me
Lady, there is no need to fight
Lady, don't you try to find me
Lady, it will be alright

We sail today, tears will drown in your wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
Along the way, the sea will crowd us with lovers at night
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life
I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time

 Yeah, but nobody searches
Nobody cares somehow
When the loving that you've wasted
Comes raining from a hapless cloud
And I might stop and look upon your face
Disappear in the sweet, sweet gaze
See the living that surrounds me
Dissipate in a violet place

Can't you see what you've done to my heart
And soul?
This is a wasteland now

We spies
We slow hands
Put the weights around yourself
We spies
Oh yeah, we slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
Now

I submit, my incentive is romance
I watched the pole dance of the stars
We rejoice because the hurting is so painless
From the distance of passing cars
But I am married to your charms and grace
I just go crazy like the good old days
You make me want to pick up a guitar
And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you
Can't you see what you've done to my heart
And soul?
This is a wasteland now

We spies
Yeah, we slow hands
Put the weights around yourself

Oh, yeah, we slow hands

C'mon, c'mon
Hey!

My best friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries
Oh look, it stopped snowing
My best friend's from Poland and, oh, he has a beard
But they caught him with his case in a public place
That is what we had feared

He severed segments and secretly liked that
He always took the time to speak with me, I liked him for that
He severed segments and secretly liked that
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)
He always took the time
He always took the time

 Show me the dirt pile and I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
You vanish with no guile and I will not pay, but the soul can wait
The soul can wait

Well, it's still pretty what with all these leaves, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
But if it's still pretty what with all these leaves, we'll be fine, oh
And supervise

You show me the dirt pile and I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
Then you vanish with no guile and I will not pay, but the soul can wait
I felt you so much today

I know you try
You try, straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
Girl, I know you try
You fly straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
But here comes the falls
So much for make-believe, I'm not sold
So much of dreams deceit, I'm not prepared to know
Your heart makes me feel, your heart makes me bold
For always and ever, I'll never let go
Always concealed, safe and inside
Alive

Show me the dirt pile and I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
In a passion it broke; I pull the black from the gray, but the soul can wait
I felt you so much today8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Summon us for peace
Do what we can

Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the Earth
These others roam
Besieged by desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You play me out
That looked like your chance to me
But you played me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
It's a real life desire
Come on baby
You play me out
You lay me out
That looked like your chance to me

Remember take hold of your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail

We marshal in the days of longing
We tremble like anyone's children
And wink towards the fire

I'm erring on the side of caution
Betraying no other symptom
But girl, you shake it right

I will bounce you on the lap of silence
We will free up to the beats of science
And girl, you shake it right
I'll say it now

Oh, but hold it still, darling, your hair so pretty
Can't you feel the warmth of my sincerity?
You make motion when you cry
You're making people's lives feel less private
Don't take time away
You make motion when you cry
We all hold hands
Can't we all hold hands
When we make new plans?

I pretend like no one else

 Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look; it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

Cut the cord

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've got to let me go

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer

When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus

Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now

Every once in a little while

 What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous
I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man

Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running, she's running

Tell me what you wanna know

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know, I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"

Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run
From east to west

I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes

The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"

 Save some face, you know you've only got one
Change your ways while you're young
Boy, one day you'll be a man
Oh, girl, he'll help you understand

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

Looking back at sunsets on the East side
We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things slide by so carelessly

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

Oh no, oh, no, no, no

 Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, "Ain't we all just runaways? We got time"

But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you run away
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah, runaways
Ain't we all just runaways?

 Wheels are turnin'
I remember when you were mine
Just to reach you
Baby, I'd stand in line
There's another world
We're livin' in tonight
And there's another heart
That's fadin' in the light

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't want your memories in my head, no
I want you here with me

Spent the summer just layin' out in the sun
Time seems to move so slowly, when you're taking it as it comes
Maybe we were just too young
Your body was tan and your hair was long
You shot me a smile and my cares were gone
Fallin' in love filled my soul with fright
You said, "Come on, babe, it'll be alright"
I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again
I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me

Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)
I keep on waitin' for you
For you to come around
Come around and say

I don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't need those memories in my head, no
I want you here with me
Ahhhhh

Ahhhhh

 You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there we’d won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life
All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows through the moonlight
Taking chances on a hot night
For a second there we won
We were innocent and young

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's a proving ground)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn to chance)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love
(Miss Atomic Bomb)

Holding on for your life
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Compelling me

Let me introduce you to the featherweight queen
She got Hollywood eyes
But you can't shoot what she's seen
Her mama was a dancer
And that's all that she knew
'Cause when you live in the desert
It's what pretty girls do

I'm throwin' caution

Tonight the winds of change are blowin' wild and free
If I don't get out
Out of this town
I just might be the one who finally burns it down

I'm throwin' caution
I'm throwin' caution
Never had a diamond on the sole of her shoes
Just black top, white trash
Straight out of the news
Doesn't like birthdays
They remind her of why
She can go straight from zero
To the Fourth of July

I'm throwin' caution
What's it gonna be?
Tonight the winds of change are comin' over me
If I don't get out
Out of this town
I just might be the one who finally burns it down

 I tried going against my own soul's warning
But in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving even though the sky was storming
I just wanted to get back to where you are

If you could see through the banner of the sun
Into eternity's eyes, like a vision reaching down to you
Would you turn away?
What if it knew you by your name?
What kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?

I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving, even though the sky was storming
Thunderheads were forming

But then I thought I could fly
And when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far
I just wanted to get back to where you are
I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried running from the memory and the mourning
But the penalty kept on pouring

And now I think I know why
'Cause when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far

 A Dustland fairytale beginning with just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to, some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade

Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was lookin' for a night gown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
We're drawbridges closin'
Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide
Out where the dreams all hide

Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and senators? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick

I walked into town with a message for my old man
I've got the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand
Steve painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light

His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back (Here comes the calling)
But Daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost? (Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they fix it all up in post

The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Or keys to the kingdom
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light

You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight

But what would you do if he walked in the room?
Make for the left, or break for the right?

 Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
I see the mouths are open, but I can't hear the song
I've done my best to fill 'em, but the cracks are starting to spread
Hey I won't blame you baby, go on turn your head

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

I can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine
The truth is on the table, someone's gotta sign
I've done my best defending, but the punches are starting to land
I'm sliding into something you won't understand

So I'm handing you a memory
I hope you understand
That steadily reminds you of who I really am
This city's always breathing, I wish that it would die
The kickbacks and the bachelors, the fever for the velvet rope
The money from my mother's men

May your limits be unknown

Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
Soon enough, you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
Over rock, over chain, over trap, over plane
When they knock you down

Over sunset plane
Over trap and snare

In your made up schemes

Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind?
So goodbye

She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"

Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever

"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
(I know) Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person

So how do I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes)

Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

 It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"

All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take off fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry
I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Tryna get through it, try to bounce to it
You were not thinkin' that I will not do it
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along, oh baby136EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do

So don't be blue
There is another future
Waiting there for you

I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too

It's calling out for you
Arise and walk on through
(Time rolls on)
A world beyond that door is calling out for you
(Time rolls on)
Arise and walk on through
It's calling out for you
(Listen to it call)
Arise and walk, come through
A world beyond that door
(Listen to it call)
Is calling out for you66EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realise I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real, it feels

It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"

 Ah

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday (If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train, like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?

 If only there could be another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too

Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life, you wouldn't have to change it

 Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, it makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (Uh)61EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?


And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?


You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover
One-on-one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another
Everything that I have
Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own

I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words, sing along
(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
(I know) I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke

Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along

(This time) I wanna say, "It's all right"
(I know) You're just a man after all
And I know you had demons
I got some of my own
I think you passed them along

Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
"Does it really fucking matter, babe?" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go

I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
Now’s my time, gonna do it

And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me, and I know now
Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?
I didn't care if it was day or night
The world was right where I wanted
Girl, I'm sorry
Babe, I'm really, really sorry50EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it Heaven?
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones

So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them

'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over, boy, I demand it
So, what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry"
'Cause if they call you, embrace them
If they stall you, erase them

'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to get lost in yesterday

If it calls you, embrace it
If it haunts you, face it

I know it's mad, I understand
It's only Snakes and Ladders
The period you never had
There's only one that matters

And if it calls you, embrace it
If it holds you, erase it
Replace it16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want our footsteps to be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing

In the end it’s coming, there’s nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain, just how I'm gonna feel

I'll only know in the moment
Anticipation growing

Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mister Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
He's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)


He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (Yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

 I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
Who was that? It was my lover
A lover from a past life

From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life

Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to block out regret, but it was real
It just feels like a past life
From a past life
Crazy
From a past life
It takes a lot to trip me out
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life
(You're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)

Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?

They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up

Just growin' up in stages

Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my days are shapeless

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one

'Cause time takes from everyone

Waiting for a change to come

 We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?

She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—

I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I told my mother that I love her
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care

 'Cause I was still unsure
But it's something I'm used to
And I could tell by your face
No one's ever been rude to you
But I could tell you things
That I can't say to anyone
And you came 'round today
But you didn't stay very long

Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried whose audience will lose you

And I had no idea
What that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you've changed
By the people around you
I used to take the long way
Just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside
But I guess I won't anymore
There's so much I wanna tell you
So much I wanna tell you15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Tame Impala, 
 I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, I'm walking over
What will I do?
I never had a chance to

There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

Trying to be patient but I'm feeling ancient
Trying to control the way that I'm facing
Suppose that I didn't care anymore
Fate can decide, I can ignore
I'll just pretend that I always knew
That I had the chance to

There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Making such a promise
Only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
Trying to stay in motion
It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I can sense you doubt me
You don't need to promise
That only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left...14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I close my front door and turn on the light
I let out a breath and hold in a sigh
Ain't nothin' new, ain't that much in sight
And if I'm counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's looking like

But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding on
More than a minor setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
And all of my dreams are still in sight
'Cause strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
I lost a wheel a while back
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Challenges falling in my lap
Strung out again, but still on track

I know it's unrealistic, over-optimistic
I know I tried before this, I know it's nearly August
I know I can't ignore this, looking forward to all this
Sayin', "Babe, I just adore this" and, "Babe, can we afford this?"
I know it's been a slow year, nothin' much to show here
I didn't really go for it, so not a lot to show for it
The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're comin' over, a wall to bring us closer
The world ain't waitin' for ya, nothin' to lose it over
We're just a little older, the rest comes easy
The rest comes easy

('Cause life's like that)
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding back
Troubles keep falling in my lap
Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm still on track
So tell everyone I'll be alright
'Cause strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
More than one major setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track (Yeah)

The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower (Ooh)
So glad you're comin' over, a wall to bring us closer (Still on track, motherfucker)
The world ain't waitin' for ya, nothin' to lose it over
We're just a little older, the rest gets easy
The rest gets easy13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear that

Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Push it out the window
On and on, we all go
(This could be the day that we push through)
Into another morning
Doesn't even matter
It was only yesterday
(It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't...)
Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited

 You're up, but you'll get down
You're never running from this town
And I think you said
"You'll never get anything better than this
'Cause you're going 'round in circles
And everyone knows you're trouble"

'Cause you read it in a big book
And now you're giving me the look, look
But just remember how we shook, shook
And all the things we took, took
This town's the oldest friend of mine

We get up and we get down
We're always running 'round this town
And to think they said
We'd never make anything better than this
'Cause we're always in small circles
And everyone thinks we're trouble

We didn't read it in a big book
(We didn't read it in a big book, big book, big book)
And now we're giving you the look, look

 Just one fight and just one anniversary
So I never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
You said our love was written in the stars
But I never paid attention to my charts
But now I see how quick you must want to forget
'Cause you left the ring I bought you with your cigarettes
Well, I can finish up if you don't want them
And I can take the ring back where I got it from

(Shoop-doop-doop, ah)
I can love it or I can leave it
(Shoop-doop-doop, ah)
You said, "Honey, I best be leaving"

Never thought about it sentimentally
Never saw just how much you thought I meant to me
Never learned about it at university
Never thought about it 'cause you're the first, you see
And I'm aware of the procedure
But normally it's me that leaves her
I guess I'm finished up, it's time to move on
I'm taking the ring back to where I got it from

 You may have the money but you've got to go
It's sensible, it's sensible
And those endless seasons that go on and on
Incredible

But I'd sooner get out, remember where we went last year?
You said everything about it moved on your career
If you want to go, I'll take you back one day
'Cause this isn't Paris, and this isn't London
And it's not Berlin, and it's not Hong Kong, not Tokyo
If you want to go, I'll take you back one day

It feels so good
In the bay
It feels so good
In the bay

You may have the body but do you have the soul?
Let's make this happen, let's make this happen
And those endless beaches that go on and on
It's magical
But I'd sooner get out, remember where we went last year?
You said everything about it moved on your career
And you said, "(If you) If you (Want to go) want to go (I'll take you back one day)"
'Cause this isn't Paris, and this isn't London
And it's not Berlin, and it's not Hong Kong, not Tokyo
If you want to go, I'll take you back one day

It feels so good

The bits of yellow paper
Addressed from you to me

 Don't need your number, babe, but I'll take it anyway
I spent my nights recalling our showers in the morning
And what you said that day, I'll take it to the grave
But once I'm in the grave, you won't care anyway

So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse
So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse

No need for comfort, babe, but I'll take some anyway
Don't need the rollerblades you got on holiday
I'll take the feelings that I wish I never had
You take your favourite band, that shit was always bad

I think I've seen a ghost, she walks along this coast
And on the breakfast shows, all the FM radio hosts
Keep playing "Paparazzi" (Playing "Paparazzi")
I think I loved you most when we were in my Capri
So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse

 Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, I haven't got one

Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

 Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over...

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over
Over and over...
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said:
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms..."

It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

 Oh, take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere
Drop me anywhere
In Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
But I don't care
I should like to see—

I don't bless them

Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said, "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said, "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration
(Oh, oh-oh)

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty, oh, oh
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair, oh
(These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

 A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives, where are they now?
With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived, and then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry
You say: "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall
You say: "'Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on mine

Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play

On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
Provincial towns you jog 'round
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ

 Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the twenty-first century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history, Mr. Shankly

Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous
Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr. Shankly
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain in the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
Still, I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly
Oh, give us your money!10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly
But, "Take me to the haven of your bed"
Was something that you never said
Two lumps, please
You're the bee's knees but so am I

Oh, meet me at the fountain
Shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly

Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine, it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
Oh ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Ohh...

Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?

Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not very often

Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days

 All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I can surely rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none
But now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to!
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

So, what difference does it make? (Oooooh)
What difference does it make? (Oooooh)
It makes none
But now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies

How near you stand to me
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know

Kiss my shades...

The Good People laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"

For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer

And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
Oh

End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say "give in to lust
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust"
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am

And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone

Oh
I could have been wild and I could have been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith

Run Manchester schools
Spineless swines
Cemented minds

Jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up education
As a bad mistake

Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbow in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates

When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh

But that joke isn't funny anymore

And it's too near the bone

Sixteen, clumsy and shy

I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said "I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?"

And she wrote to me equally dour
She said "In the days when you were hopelessly poor
I just liked you more"

This world without you
I can't take it, I can't take it on my own

On these roads
Out of love, so it goes
How it feels when we fall, when we fold
How we lose control, on these roads
How it sings as it goes
Flight of field, driving snow
Knows the cold
Ran round the wailing world

And what's a song without you?
When every song I write is about you
When I can't hold myself without you
And I can't change the day I found you

 The sea was large today
Just as any other day
But something broke in me
Watching on this winter’s eve
Like a voice, that I’d been trying to hide
Pulled me close
And out into the undertow
I can’t beat it
Oh! The sirens sing me home
Just can’t release it
I didn’t have the strength to go
She’s a garden rose and blossoms head to toe
And even when she leaves her golden shadow stings
I can’t beat it
Every time she goes, cuts me even deeper
If only I’d the strength to go
Like she does
But she’s got time on her side
And she’s free to decide
Because she’s got time on her side
To be young is divine
And scaling the dunes to sea
Where the white wall feeds
Gets me no closer to peace
From the grips that she holds on me
Oh! I can’t beat it
Every time she goes
Cuts a lil deeper
So the wound will never close
If only I could beat it
She wouldn’t look away for woe
But it finds me when I’m sleeping
And wakes me in a fevered low
Like she does
But she’s got time on her side
And she’s free to decide
Because she’s got time on her side
She’s so free, it’s sublime
I just wonder if I’m on her mind
As she’s on mine, all the time
And I want her to know that I’m on her side
I’m on her side
The sea was large today
Just as any other dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Doubled the top knot
Flew out the lattice door
Do what he wouldn’t
Do what he couldn’t do
No lack of ‘wouldn’t’ could be my undoing
No lack of trying
No lack of sighing ‘loo’
Weave songs of loving late
Dream songs of dying
Recite the oakwood flame
Rings count my olden days
I’ve seen the beaches
Breached the peak of ‘please’ and ‘thanks’
I’ve seen my features age
My fingers strange
From the dew
From the dew, of the fields
We grew
And I built a ship for two
It waits for me and you
In the dew of the fields
Is it real?
Is it real?
I’ll show you the way
Just walk beside the low stream until it fades
Into a melon colored field
The wind will know your name
And you don’t have to run
You don’t have to change
Don’t ever change…
We were the candles that lit up the snow on dusty roads
We were the animals breathing life into June just to see faith
Blessed by the cannibal moon and the spoon dipping deep to your nose
Stressed by the distance of shoes and the bridges too far to be named
Was it real?
When we held our hands close to flame
Just to feel
I’ll show you the way
Just walk beside the low stream until it fades
Into a honey colored field
The wind will know your name
And you don’t have to change
You don’t have to change
Love is real
Our love was real
It’s a hand
It’s a hold
It’s a shield
Our love was real
Our love was real
It’s to hope
It’s to dream
It’s to heal

 In parting ways
And parting hearts
A dress of leaves blows to the winds
Take these sacrificial remnants—untended
Bashed to dust
And trust distressed
Red cheeks—caved in
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz all we know, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't grieve anymore
Cuz all I hold, is all I own
Is this a desperate wish for dying?
Or a wish that dying cease?
The fear that keeps me going and going and going
Is the same fear that brings me to my knees
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Cuz all we are, is bled and gone
I am the air, the after
Always in the clouds
Searching for some answer
Parted now, I am the shore—repeated
Becoming air
I'm finally free
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
What I can't see, can't hold to me

You said you'd meet me there
I've been tripping off constellations and stars
I found you at home, what was our home
With another man, oh man
Been keeping you in my heart

And so I whispered into your ear
"What are you thinking about?"
You just looked up at the stars
And so I whispered into your ear
"Who are you thinking about?"
It couldn't be me

And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without yourself to defend
You know you hurt me so bad
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I’ve never seen
I really wanted you there
But you ruined what was love
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
Just ‘cause you needed a hand

This is the way that it all falls
This is how I feel
This is what I need

I was impoverished
Those ties that wind
And stared into open lanes
Stared into long long nights
Howling and still
West of the Eastern Cove
Carving the wind
Dawn of your eyes
Dust off your smile

When you say "us"
You make me trust

I will never keep you from an open door
I know, you know
That’s how much I feel in everything you are
You know, I know

Hot as the day
When we sat on stones
Watching the fish, run
Under our feet, and flow
And dove from the rocks
Scraping my knees and toes
And blood, with me, rose
Slow from the sea
And you were waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me

Don’t watch me weep into my palms
Don’t watch me leaving, I’ll be gone
Kiss me mother, Kiss me father
Fore I go
Don’t want to leave you
But I’m sorry... I can’t hold
And you see me, through the roses
Through the lights and the smoke and the screen
I’m no one better
I’m no better than you and I'm scared
Just searching for truth
It’s not easy, just being human
And the lights and the smoke and the screens
Don’t make it better
I’m no stronger than you and I’m scared
I don't know what to do
I’m scared
That I can’t pull through
In the weak of my soul
The temptation to look inside my wrist—it grows
The cut is waiting
The cut is waxing in its hold
The clutch of nothing
The curse of wanting
Takes me whole
And you see me, through the roses
Through the lights and the smoke and the screen
I’m no one better
I’m no better than you and I’m scared
Just searching for truth
It’s not easy, just being human
And the lights and the smoke and the screens
Don’t make it better
I’m no stronger than you and I’m scared
I don't know what to do
I’m scared
But we can pull through—together
Together
We can pull throughEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Future Islands, 
 I’ve broken many promises
But this one I would die to keep
When I said I’d be there tomorrow
Beside you as you sleep
I was scared, cuz I’ve lost so many things before
Kept me running from the world and from myself
You gave me second chance and hopes to run to
I couldn’t bare to spend — another day without you
I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away
From your door, from your door
What if the sun don’t shine?
Well then the birds won’t sing
Just then the blizzard came
Covered you, half a world away
Now I’m stuck in this place, without you
Thinking—what should I do?
All I knew—I couldn’t wait—one more night
And if this plane won’t fly
Then I’ll drive…
'Cause I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away, from you
I’m gonna catch you
Blinding snow can’t keep me away
From your door, from your door
What if the sun don’t shine
Well then the birds won’t sing
Just then the blizzard came
Covered you, half a world away, a world asleep
And I was scared
Cuz I’ve lost so many things before
Kept me running—from the world—and from myself
You gave me second chance and hopes to run to
I couldn’t bare to spend—another day without you
Cuz I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away, from you
I’ve gotta find you
Hurricanes can’t keep me away….from you
Fire and chains can’t keep me away…from you
Falling planes can’t keep me away…from you
From you…
From youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 My window opens on your heart
Yet shadows divide our worlds with loss
The light setting, in the corner of my room
Isn't enough, but is it for you?
A melody that trails and falls, yet never fully blooms
Plays like an old song
That’s just out of tune
Why can't you just break free?
Is it the heat dreams, that fevers brought you?
These old shadows (they're just shadows)
They turn me like a screw
And dance the dance of Dante, entreating you
They're just shadows (these old shadows)
Won't let me get close to you
I'm walking a ghost, through the Garden of Eden’s ruins
(I’m tryna get through to you)
The light setting, in the corner of my room
Plays like an old song that's just out of tune
A melody that trails and falls yet never fully blooms
Is it enough? well is it for you?
Why won't you just take me?
Is it the bee's sting that honey haunts you?
Is it the sweet things you fear--you'll lose
If I get near, to you?
Before we’re through…
These old shadows (These old shadows)
Parade you like a fool, you’re living in dust
While a ghost hangs coats on you
These old shadows (They're just shadows)
Crotcheted and trembling, nude
I’m walking a ghost but I wanna walk next to you
I wanna break through to you
The light setting in the corner of my room
Isn’t enough, well is it for you?
The light setting, in the corner of your room
It’s more than enough, for me and for you
For me and for you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Left out on the road eight years ago
And you left too but I never really thought you would really go
If I knew then—I’s really losing you
I’d change my ways and my mind—fore I lose control
Cuz in a darkened space, we watched our souls replace
And said our ‘goodbyes’
But we didn’t know the shape
And for years now
I been hunting you down
Trying to find out
Your hiding place
Oh, at last!
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
Where does it go?
You spend your whole life wishing and working all you gets the end of the rope
Oh what do we know?
You spend your whole life searching and find the thing you’re looking is what you lost so long ago
And for years now, I’ve been hunting the sound
That soft breath on the back of my neck, got me running…
Oh, at last!
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
Oh we were young
And in love
I was young
And in loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Ancient like the water
Dissolves my selfish leanings and all the others
Guide me
You beside me
With conviction—my lost invention
My child is starving
But you keep me, you keep me
I’ve been locked and you’re the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me ’til I’m ready to be free
Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
Forgetting what giving and living can be—what it can mean
First forgiving myself and stepping outside of my own apathy
To see, I just want to be
Patient like the forest
Stood through thousands fallen
Watched the changing evening a million times or more
Lead me to the water
Take me to the other side
And know how much it means, to me
Cuz you keep me, you keep me
I’ve been locked and you’re the key
Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
I’ve forgotten what giving and living can be—what it can mean
First steps to being better is doing the smallest things
Cuz you keep me, you keep me
You keep me I’ve been locked and you’re the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me ’til I’m strong enough to see
To be freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I take my licks - like a man
Facing forward
I made my bed, it wasn't yours
How soon we'd forget - what we shared
You said you'd always be mine
I nodded and smiled
Tongue out of my head
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
Tell me now, is it love?

We did the best that we can
Across the world
We made a plan, it wasn't yours
How soon we'd forget - what we shared
In folding sands
Our castle, no more
The magic - sleight of hand

Is this lover?
Or the love of the chase?
I had you once, you kept forgetting my name
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
What was your name?
Was it something like me, me, me?

We recede in the fog
As to breathe in this calm
And forget this walk
To leave, you and all
We were more than the fall
And I hope you'd agree
Like sunlight through the fog
Always chasing me
Lil bluebell in shade - what was your name?
Was it something like me?
Lil bluebell in shade
What was your name?
Was it something like me, me, me?
Now, is it love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is it love?
Is it love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is this love?5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I caught you sleeping here, all wrapped in wool
I caught you sleeping here, almost broke my heart
I found you dreaming
I'm dreaming of you always, always
When I was just a child, a lonely boy
I held onto my dreams, like they could run from me
The hopes I harbored fled - as they often do
But I still dreamed of you
And now my dream's come true
And as we say goodnight, I hold you close and tight
No more raging suns, only waning ones
Like the waxing scar where my lonely heart --
Once bloomed  -- before, I met you
My little dreamer, I'll always
Always, dream of you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Trusted, repeated
Candor, uneven - in it's will to find
The right design
The form belongs, to no one
Holding truth
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you

Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth for dreams come to those
Who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Be more than words
Be more than strength and kind
Be love and blind
To those who come to you
Sing something new
Belief is wet and ghost
Yet, loves the most of what we do

Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Those winter days
Those winter nights
Those days and those nights
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you

Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Challenge you, challenge you
Challenge you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 She looks like the moon
She says, "it's your eyes"
She sees everything
She knows me too well
And she looks like the day
She says, "it's the light"
Something in the way she says "goodbye"
And she looks like the moon
So close and, yet, so far
She says everything
She knows me too well
And I can call you "friend"
And I can be the world
Silent chatter held
I won't be around
And I can be a friend
But I won't be around
Silent chatter, bound
Just don't push me out!
And she looks like the moon
She says, "it's your eyes"
She says everything
She knows me too well
And I can call you "friend"
But I won't be around
Silent chatter, bound
Just don't push me out...
We don't have to speak tonight
Just don't say "goodbye"
Making a home in my body
Letting it grow in my body
Taking these chains from my body
Letting it go from my body
Letting it go from my body
Taking these chains from my body
Is harder than you know
Oh!
And she looks like the moon
She says, "it's your eyes"
She says everything
She knows me too well

She says, "it's the light"
Something in the way she says, "goodbye"
Just don't say goodbye

 And you can clean around the wound
But if you want it to heal
It just takes time
And you can go up to the Moon
But if you want something to change
You gotta change your life
And take your time
It just takes time
It just takes time
It just takes time
Hard work and your time
And the Sun will leave the room
And leave you to the night
And that's alright
Because before the morning comes
There's a certain calm
And then there's light
It just takes time
It just takes time
A little trust and your time
You can change your life
It just takes time
A little trust and your time
And I can sit and talk
Because I was just like you
So arrogant and brave
Impetuous and blue
But trust me as a friend
And I'll do all that I can do
And I'd do anything for you
Because I want to see you through
It just takes time
Hard work and your time
You can change your life
It just takes time
A little trust and your time...

 When I couldn't see you for the wall
What was that you said?
What was that you said before you called?
And when I couldn't catch you for the fall
What was that you said?
What was that you said?
"Nothing hurts this much"
But I've seen the way
That bodies lie
And bodies tend to break
And I've been away
I've been away too long
Too long to be afraid

But you know
What you know is better
Is brighter
And you know
You know
What you know is better
Is brighter
And this is where we were, when I showed you the dark
Inside of me, in spite of me
On a bench in the park
You said to me:
"This is not you
This is not you
This is not you!
This is not you"
But I've seen the way
That bodies lie
And bodies tend to break
And I've been away
I've been away too long
And I don't know a better place


And this is where we are
In your bed, in my arms
Outside of me
In spite of 'we'
I showed you the dark
And you said to me:
"You know
What you know is better
Is brighter"
"And you know, you know
What you know is better
Is brighter"6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Old river
Come quietly
Just asking
A glass of water
They don't know me
Don't try me

Nobody gonna pick me up
I'm falling down
And I'm 5th St. bound
Now nobody wanna fill me up
I've fallen down
None of my friends around

Seen it on the news
Looked like me and you
Did they hear me calling?

Blue water
Black rider
Keep on rolling
Keep on riding
Old silver
Old Tar River
Keep running
Black water
Old river
That old Tar River
Just keeps rising
Inside me
Nobody gonna pick me up
I'm falling down
And I'm 5th St. bound

Seen it on the news
Some never seem to lose
They say, the rest are fallen
I seen it on the news
It wasn't mine to lose
Do they hear me calling?

(Heavy this leans inside me)
Keep Rising
(The river seethes)
(Parting the ground beneath me)
Keep Rising
(Just like the sea)
Oh, Tar River
(Watching it washing over)
Tar River
(The broken reeds)
It grows inside me
(Gambling the rushing water)
Keeps on running (Over me)
Keeps rising (Over me)
Keeps rising (Over me)

Like forever was
In a chrysalis, she waits for us
And she takes from us
Oh sweet life, why give and take from us?
It's all for you

Feels like I'm holding you down
But you won't leave me alone
And you're holding me now
But I'm so far away from you
There's no home
No home like the one I found in you
Now you're running away
Oh, to feel like a child again...

And the song he sings, he brings to life for you
It's all for you
It's all for you...
And he words he places on the page just can't admit
This song's for you
This song's for you...
Feels like you're holding me down
But I can't leave you alone
And I'm holding you now
But you're so far and lost to me
There's no home
No home like the one I found in you

 Home isn't open
It's like, when you get here
The tracks by the creek bed
The minnow's the body
Crawdads with their heads down low
Back in the tall grass
Stinging my cattails, oh!
Looking for brother
It feels like winter
But it's the heart of the summer
We can't go swimming
As long as we slumber
'Cause we're a long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
How did we get here?

One step takes me home
Two steps back on my own
Three skips to each stone
Four steps back and I'm gone

And I wanted you to know
I was thinking about you
And you look like a rose
Especially
When I'm a long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
How did we get here?
Back to the body
Words jump like salmon

One step takes me home
Two steps back on my own
Three skips to each stone
Four steps back and I'm gone

And I wanted you to know
I was thinking about you
And you look like a rose
Especially
In that backwater
Running through the woods
In that red water
In the mirror
Thinking of you
Spend all day just thinking of you
In the mirror thinking of you
Spend my days just thinking of you
Oh, baby, thinking of you
All day, thinking of you
And I wanted you to know
I was thinking about you
And baby you look like a rose

 Our second step was river quiet
We walked along the Rockies, stones admired
Calcite greens and feather bones divided
Morning’s first born and a day-glow fire
Day glow fire
In your upstairs room, I sit in silence
No longer a guest in your bed
Or in your heart or head
Surrounded by your things and memories entire
Not finding any trace of me
I know it’s time to leave
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
I packed my bags last night
I always pick the strangest ways to say, ‘goodbye’
But I had to come and see that this had died
I had to look into your eyes
Just one last time
Just one last time
Oh I had to look into your eyes!
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run

 You couldn't possibly know how much you mean to me
You couldn't honestly look inside my tarot
You couldn't possibly find it in your heart to forgive me
You are the savage sun and scarecrow

And time -- goes by
And you've got a lot to learn, in your life
And the heart's not inside
And I've got to find the one that's just right

You offer all amends in hopes of saving me
You never imagined I could be strong without you
You offer me a branch of peace that bleeds through
The thorns that welcomed me -- now speak truth

And time -- goes by
And you've got a lot to learn, in your life
And the heart's not inside
And I've got to find the one that's just right

Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows

Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Far above the moon

Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried

How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd

I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)

 Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Starman waiting in the sky

There's a starman waiting in the sky

Artist:David Bowie, 
 It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?104EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:David Bowie, 
 Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

This way or no way
You know I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now, ain't that just like me?
Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?

 Oh yeah
Mmm

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Oh yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I said that time may change me

 We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face

 Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom

 Oh yeah

Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our bones?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was The Nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Get things done

 Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing (sighing)
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot

Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried

Smote the mistress, drifting on

 Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no, love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)

 They pulled in just behind the fridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
But she wants the young American

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

All night
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American) young American
(You want the young American) All right
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American) young American

All right
I want the young American, young American

 The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon
From station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near


It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway) while colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

(Let's dance) for fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance) for fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) you could look into my eyes
(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

Artist:David Bowie, 
 Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to?
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The Earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)

Artist:David Bowie, 
 Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving


Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

 I ain't hanging up this time
I ain't giving up tonight
Even if you walk around as though you think you're right
At your worst I still believe it's worth the fight

I could make it all go away
Tell me what you’re thinking, don't delay
We could still be having some sweet memories
This heart still beats for you, why can't you see?

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight

Stop pretending I'm not there
When it's clear I'm not going anywhere
If I'm out of sight then take another look around
I'm still out there hoping to be found

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
I could make it all disappear
You could feed me all of your fears
We could end all this pain right here
We could rewind all of those tears
I could take it down to the floor
You don't have to feel it anymore
A love so real that it can't be ignored
It's all over, baby blue, I'm still yours
I'm still yours

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright

 I quit my dreaming the moment that I found you
I started dancing just to be around you
Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more
I kept my mouth shut and opened up the door
I wanted nothing but for this to be the end
For this to never be a tied and empty hand
If all the trouble in my heart would only mend
I lost my dream, I lost my reason all again
It's not just me for you
I have to look out too
I have to save my life
I need some peace of mind
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now

 Saw it in her eyes
Oh, it wasn't what she said
She came together like a dream
That I didn't know I had
From the sleeping life I lead
All the colors I have seen
I can't help but recognize
The brighter one in front of me
All the truth I thought I learned
And then it finally came along
Turned around and then it's there
All the love I thought was gone

I want to know you
I want to show you
I want to be there
I want to see her
Piece us together
Know it's forever
Show me the future
Tell me you'll be there
I want to go where
Nobody knows fear
I want to follow
My heart down that wild road
Everywhere I go
I can see your face
Alive and gone at once
Hey, that's the way I see this place
And all this blessing was a curse
Before I opened up my heart
You learn to take it as it comes
You fall together, fall apart

I want to know you
I want to show you
I want to be there
I want to see her
Live it through your eyes
Piece us together
Know that this wild road
Will go on forever
I want to live life
I want to die right

 Coming from an endless place
Heaven hits me when I see your face
I go blind, every time

Hate to have to watch you go
Thought I'd been through this
Lord knows, I've been trying, I'm still trying

You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine

Turn and walk away
I would watch you, look right through me
Right through every word that I say

He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do
But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
Yes, I would watch you, learn to love you
And her, too, if you'd only stay, but

You'll never be mine

If  only we could start again
Pretending we don't know each other
I could not come back the same
This  city's changed, it's not what it was
Back  when you loved me
Walking down that path we made
When  we thought what we had was such a good thing

Hiding out inside my head
It's me again, it's no surprise
I'm on my own now
Every  time I turn to you
I see the past, it's all that lasts
And all I know how
Learn to look me in the eyes
Yet I still don't feel it's me you're facing
Say your heart is always mine
What about old times? You can't erase them

Wishing we could only find one another
All we've done here is blind one another
Hate can't live in this heart here forever

Told me that I was the woman
He'd always be losing, always be dreaming

Know that I'm hanging on to the things that you said
The things that you said

I felt my soul rise up from my body
When I look into your blue eyes
If cosmic force is real at all
It’s come between you and I

It's just another intern with a résumé
I am going to fall in love with you some day
I'm gonna fall in love and run away

Everyone I know has got their own ideal
I just want to be alive, make something real

Something in the world will make a fool of you

This parade is almost over
And I'm still your clown

How your smile seems to last forever
Even if it's just a while
We are there together
There together

With no promise of the future
Am I not allowed
To think kindly of a stranger
Who reflects the sound
Of my heartache
As it's beating
My life to the ground
To the ground
To the ground
To the ground
To the ground

And I could still breathe for you
Open up and scream for you
Tell me what I wouldn't do
Tell me that love isn't true
Tell me that love isn't true
Tell me that love isn't true
I dare you to understand
What makes me a woman
What makes me a woman
What makes me a woman

Or was it your shelter?
Or was it another

Got a heart shaped face
Was it a feeling you thought I could dig up or erase?

I've seen you changing
I've seen you aging

And I learned how to turn my head
And I learned how to walk away
And the truth never really lives
In the story of words we say
You never needed anyone
To expose you to yourself
And you never needed anyone
To raise you hell out of your mind
I never wanted to be someone
Who had to leave it all behind
Even still there is no escape
For what I face, I faced before
Have whatever love you wanna have
But I can't be here anymore

 I watch from a tower in the back of my mind
I watch from a window as the living walk by down below
Walking with quiet dreams, walking out, quiet day
And in my head, I might be sorry
It makes no difference now
I might be wishing I had some place to go
Hit the streets, out in search for the self that has left me lying
And I never seem to notice, it's too late before I know
That all the love inside has been empty
The world we made has been ending
And like a ghost that hangs around
And won't forgive its earthly sins
I've carried on this love for you
It's how my body lives
My darling, how are you? How have you been lately?
I only seem to speak to you of superficial things
Creator, you destroy me, you know my hunger well
And yet you starve me until I'm begging on my knees
And these are a few of very many things I can't begin to say out loud
If only this song could carry us on, but I know I'm only entertaining myself
I felt that even after I've been stripped of all my pride
There still remains a place for you to crawl up inside
To crawl up inside, to crawl up inside
And I'm out of my mind, out of my mind
Murderous bitch, I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind to be in love with you
The way that I'm in love with you
The way that I'm in love with you

How time has revealed how
Little we know us
I've been too busy

Days that keep slipping
A life that I'm missing
I wish it were true love
I wish we were kissing

Show me a love that
Won't ever leave or
Look for another
One to deceive
I'm beginning to wonder
If anything's real
Guess we're just at the mercy
Of the way that we feel

Alive with a past

Alone with a heart
No other can bear
So give me some heaven

 Everything is tragic, it all just falls apart
But when I look into your eyes, it pieces up my heart
If I only had an answer to put it all to bed
I wish sometimes I could take back every word I've said
I walk back in the night alone, got caught up in my song
Forgot where I was sleeping, none of the lights were on
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I laughed so loud inside myself, it all began to hurt
So I turned on a picture show, I disappeared the lines
As memories came flooding in, the tears blew out my eyes
I see an elevator a moment I am above
I look for you or someone who can still remind me of
The tight grip and the sun lick
And the calm way of all things summer
When it's all here, and it's all new
And you're not hungover
Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
When you don't know that you're wrong
Or just how wrong you are
My feet are always heavy as I inch toward the door
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change
If you've still got some light in you, then go before it's gone
Burn your fire for no witness; it's the only way it's done
Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground and run5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Angel Olsen, 
 Do you remember the way that it used to be?
I waited for you
You kept on searching with me
Feeling free
Wanting to see each other all of the time
Those were the days
Nothing to lose and nothing to find

I see you laughing with those you don't know as well
I hear you say I'm the one but I wish I could tell
Ain't it funny how time can make you realize and make you realize
And then realize

But I'll take all of it
Don't want to leave it behind
I'll take all of it
If it's only real in my mind
Real in my mind
Real in my mind

Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Love you love you love you
Even when it's all on my own
All on my own
Do you remember the way that it used to be?
I waited for you
You kept on searching with me
Feeling free
Wanting to see each other all of the time
Those were the days
Nothing to lose and nothing to find3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You are the crazy acrobat
You are the witch
I am your cat
I want to be a bit like you
I hope you don't mind
If I do
I love the way your body's made
I love the way your voice is sex
To be the whisper upon your ear
I want to be the bed you miss
I am alive
I am alive
I thought
I thought that I died
Who cares?
I'm not a moralist
I'm just a lady with some time
I want to be made out of love
I want to be made into life
I love the way you take a walk
And the all the things you see with your eyes
Oh, to be that distant thought
Some growing meaning in your mind
I am alive
I am alive
I thought that I died
I thought that I died5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 All is forgiven
Alright, you are forgiven
If there's one thing I fear
If there's one thing I fear
It's knowing you're around
So close but not here
So close
Oh, but not with me here
So close
But not with me here
All is forgotten
All is forgotten
I've made up my mind
I've made up my mind
I've wasted my time
Making up my mind
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
But I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Will you ever forgive me
A thousand times through
For loving you?
For loving you?
For loving you?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Angel Olsen, 
 My watch is blurry when I look down at my hands
I'm just another, alive with impossible plans
I turn the lights low but we both know where we are
And when it's over, what becomes of your pure heart?
A love that never seems to curse or to confine
Will be forever never lost or too defined
To lose the feeling of an endless searching through-out
To help meet what is never about me or you
That is the kind of love I'd always dreamed to be
However painful, let it break down all of me
'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
Becoming true
Becoming true
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Become a prophet
Become a fool
Or let the light shine in
Oh, let the light shine in
Or let the light shine in
May the best of you win
Who is your truest friend?
Are they there at your end?
Oh, let the light be bled
And let some tears be shed
Do it all over again
Oh, let the light shine in
It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna break you, it's just gonna shake you
Shake you alive
Baby
Oh, baby
Oh, let the light shine in
Oh, let the light shine in
Oh, let the light shine in
May the best of you win3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 It's easy when you're passionate
It's  easy when you know your way around
It's  easy when you love something
It's easy if you know exactly how

It's easy to openly say
Oh,  that you could never change your mind
That  feeling coming over you
It would never dare leave you behind

It's  easy if you tell the truth
But knowing what it is, it's not enough
Knowing that you love someone
Doesn't mean you ever were in love

It's  never easy to admit
That maybe you just want
Just to feel something again
You just wanted to forget
That your heart was full of shit
You just wanted to forget
You just wanted to forget
It's easy when you're passionate
It's easy when you know your way around
It's easy when you love something
It's easy if you know exactly how

It's easy if you tell the truth
But knowing what it is, it's not enough
And knowing that you love someone
Doesn't mean you ever were in love

It's never easy to admit
That maybe you just want
Just to feel something again

 I feel so lonesome I could cry
But instead I'll pass the time
Sitting lonely with somebody lonely, too
Well, there’s nothing in the world I’d rather do
Now tell me if you don’t feel this way
But all I want, all I ever need
Is someone out there to believe
Sometimes believe
Not always believe
Sometimes believe
Now we don’t have to take it too extreme
We'll keep our hands, our legs, even our lips apart
But I’m giving you my heart, my heart
Are you giving me your heart?
Your heart
Are you lonely too?
Are you lonely too?
Hi-five, so am I
All of your life
Stuck in time
I’m stuck, too
I’m stuck with you, I do, I do
Do you believe?
Of you, of you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Angel Olsen, 
 Here you come along
I take a breath and remind myself that I too can be strong
Thought I was cool
Turns out I'm a fool
Clearly you've proved me wrong
I didn't know what I was missing when I was alone
And now I'm fruitlessly waiting for
Someone not thinking before they start rushing to my door
Someone to run not walk
Oh, someone to sing not talk
Oh, no hesitation at all
Sometimes I need you to be the one to call
Well I'm lost in my thoughts
They tumble ahead
Over and over again
Yeah it's true
Just take a look at what's been done to me
I've wasted time to ponder
Here I am now all Alice in Wonder
Partly I do this to myself, but why can't you see
The gesture is small, but know that it means the world to me
Oh, forgive me for wanting, I'm only learning
I've forgiven myself now, there's no returning
I want to be the one who knows the best way
I want to be the one who knows the best way
I want to be the one who knows the best way to love you
But now I'm foolishly waiting for
Someone not thinking before they start rushing to my door
Someone to run not walk
Oh, someone to sing not talk
Oh, no hesitation at all
Sometimes I need you to be the one to call
I need you to be the one
I need you to be the one
I need you to be the one1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Artist:Eminem, 
 "Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"
"But I'm only going to get this one chance" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
"Something's wrong, I can feel it" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"
"You are just what the doc ordered"

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.6KEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you1.8KEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop

 Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

Artist:Eminem, 
 I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Artist:Eminem, 
 Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice773EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 *Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L ("Evil" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date" — "Looks like an olive to me"
"Look, there's an apple!" — "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners721EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

Artist:Eminem, 
 I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
River (Ooh), river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run473EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

Artist:Eminem, 
 Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "This shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Artist:Eminem, 
 Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M

Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

That's how much we have in common (Yah!)

Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (Yah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for your advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunner (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better⁠—{gun cock}⁠—have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
And you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woah!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)

Artist:Eminem, 
 May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!

Artist:Eminem, 
 (Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch! (Yeah)
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it

Artist:Eminem, 
 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me527EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie293EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone

I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (Get it)
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Artist:Eminem, 
 I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"440EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes
It's like I'm in this
Dirt, digging up old hurt, tried everything
To get my mind off you, it won't work, all it takes
Is one song on the radio, you're right back on it, reminding me
All over again how you fucking just brushed me off and left me
So burnt, spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first, well, looks like I hit a
Growth spurt, but I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for the way that you
Turned your back on me just when I may have needed you most, oh
You thought it was over? You could just close the chapter
And go about your life like it was nothing, you ruined mine
But you seem to be doing fine, well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're 'bout to go through's tougher
Than anything I ever have suffered, can't think of a better way
To define poetic justice, can I hold grudges?
Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this", heart's saying, "I will
Once I bury this bitch alive, hide the shovel and then drive of
In the sunset"

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the picture
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine fricking hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!
Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on ya, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standard you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off579EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)354EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and
Read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse, he's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap (Rap)
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road416EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Eminem, 
 Love, love
Love, love, love
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em!

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)

Artist:Eminem, 
 Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—
In my shoes, just to see

Feel your pain, you feel mine

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh

Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (So)
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin'g to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you (So)

Yeah
To my babies:
Stay strong
Your Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world:
God gave you shoes
To fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't never let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful (So-oh-oh-oh-oh)358EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I can barely look at you
Don't tell me who you lost it to
Didn't we say we had a deal?
Didn't I say how bad I'd feel?
Everyone needs a helping hand
Who said I would not understand?
Someone up the social scale
For when you're going off the rails, have

Post break-up sex
That helps you forget your ex
What did you expect from post break-up sex?

Leave it 'til the guilt consumes
Fucking in the nearest room
All our friends were unaware
Most had just passed out downstairs
To think I'd hoped you'd be okay
No, I can't think of what to say
Maybe I misunderstood
But I can't believe you're feeling good from

 Down, down in my bones
Somewhere I'd never have known
Right at the back of my head
It hit me like a beam of light
Hit me like a hook of the right
And I could have fell to the floor

'Cause you talk to me and it comes off the wall
You talk to me and it goes over my head
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you

I try my best to unwind
Nothing on my mind but you

Oblivious to all that I'll owe
I'm hanging on to what I don't know

Tall, sharp hips

No mystery with no great capabilities, but
I could make out as if I had it, but you know

Reserved and shy, your average guy
No piercing stare, just out of shape with messy hair but
I always figured I was somebody and wait
And now I'm guessing that my moment must be late

I'm not magnetic or mythical
I'm suburban and typical
But I got it, I got it
I'm overrun with it all

Seductive charm, a way with words
So effortless not leather clad or dangerous, but

I have a photo where John Lennon may have stood

For goodness sake let us be young
'Cause time gets harder to outrun

We all got old at breakneck speed
Slow it down, go easy on me
Go easy on me

Put a wetsuit on, come on, come on
Grow your hair out long, come on, come on
Put a t-shirt on
Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong

If it's up and after you
What do you suppose that you would do?
You're all whacked out from lack of sleep
You blame it on the friends you keep
Well, you want to do things differently
Go do them independently

Submerged your vision's just obscured
You're a lot like me
In up to our knees
In over your chest is way too deep

Or you could get that rap from someone else
And I could make an observation
If you want the voice of a generation
But I’m too self absorbed to give it clout

And I, I don’t really care about

Cause when you’re young and bored and 24
And don’t know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it’s hard to come of age
I think it’s a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed

And I hope it’s just a phase

I'm glad you're feeling guilty now that you're better off than some

But she might jump in if I show her to the deep end

Yeah
And it makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head

She says that if I wanted romance I could find it in the past
But if I wanna face the music then I only have to ask
So she sings me one I know as if we're sittin' 'round the fire
And there ain't no feeling like the feeling of desire

Yeah
And it makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub

And it makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub

It makes my headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Who put bars across your window of opportunity?
Did you see?
You call me a broken record
But I'll, but I'll never be
I am trying to be honest
If I end up sounding cold
It's the middle of the winter
And I wanted you to...

Hear me out! I'm out on the street
And I'm trying to find your building, baby
Here I am! I beat a retreat
I've been going 'round in circles, lately

I'm not in love but can we just pretend?
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through and then I called you
I'm not in love but can we just pretend?
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through and then I called you

You told me I'm hard to live with
But you said it out of spite
I may put you through some suffering
But I never prove you right
It's a chapter that you're stuck on
And you'd rather read alone
I'm an uninspiring ending
But the best you've ever known
I'm not in love but can we just pretend?
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through and then I called you

 In a world of minimal affection
Can you give yourself in a word
To a girl with a washed-out complexion
She's a mutual friend of ours
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone?
Is there anyone there?
You forget how to make a connection
When  you've wanted one for so long

Moving on
When you don't have a lot in common
When the world
If you don’t even know my name

What is life if not for affection?
Felt invisible, took too hard
Found an app, and drove to distraction
Is if everyone went away
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone?
Is there anyone there?
Fall back and into the quiet
Where I've wanted you for so long
Moving on
When you don't have a lot in common
When the world
If you don’t even know my name
How am I supposed to hear you calling
If I can’t hear a word you say?
How am I supposed to hear you calling
If I can’t hear a word you say?

Artist:The lumineers, 
 I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
I was not born to drown, baby come on

Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night
Baby, come on

If the Sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day?

And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent, is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that
If the Sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break

Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress, yes wear something nice
Decide on me, yeah decide on us
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois

Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out

 She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
But I still love her
I don't really care

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
And I don't blame you, dear
For running like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

 When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?
Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away

Home at last
Home at last

Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knee, I belong, I believe

Wash off my hands til it's gone
The walls they're closing in
With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Only love can dig you out of this21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Would you swear there's nobody home?
On the bed, laying awake
As you prayed he'd leave you alone

I'll let the darkness swallow me whole
I need to find you, need you to know

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea
And they wrote all these prescriptions
They wrote me off like a heel

Left me to rock in my filth

 When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And how we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured
Cause it’s a long road to wisdom
But it’s a short one
To being ignored

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it’s not too late cause you’re so attractive
And the way you move
I won’t close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

Drank the whole bottle and forgot my name
All I ever wanted was a mother for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, I smell the alcohol
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
You blamed it all on your kids
We were young, we were innocent
You told me a lie, fuck you for that
Fuck all your pride and fuck all your prayers
And all this time, I waited like a fool, and for the first time

I headed west I was a man on the move
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
And I don’t gamble, but if I did
I would bet on us

Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

You told me you were good at runnin' away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
They took the rest when you took a nap
Yes there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live it for yourself, you felt
You just felt it was time
And I’m glad, cause you with cats
That’s just not right
Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

I've been down, I been defeated
You’re the message, I will heed it
Would you stay with me
Would you stay the night, oh

Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, I'm so Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I don't own a single gun
But if I did, you'd be the one
To hold it, aim it, make all of the bad men run
But I don't own a single gun

And I don't have a sweetheart yet
But if I did, I'd break my neck to please her
Make her want to stay in my arms, she'd rest
But I don't have a sweetheart yet

I can't believe what I found in daddy's sock drawer
Sock drawer, today
It was a pistol, a Smith & Wesson
Holy— Holy shit!

One, two— One, two, three, four!
Things I knew when I was young
Some were true and some were wrong
And one day, I pray, I'll be more than my father's son
But I don't own a single gun

 Jimmy Sparks went into bars and opened up his mouth
Said some things to wounded men that they could not allow
When it came to talking, he was always on the run
Everyone knew what the man had done
Oh, he'll take you for a ride
Jimmy believed in the American way
A prison guard, he worked hard and made the minimum wage
He found his freedom lockin’ men in a cage, oh
Jimmy loved Bonnie and he fathered a kid
A baby boy, but the mother had other reasons to live
She left the baby with a note on the bed, oh
It was a struggle just to cover the rent
His jail cut hours and now his little baby was sick
He needed money and he needed it quick
It was 3 AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

Jim woke his son and buckled him in the car
They drove an hour from town and found a gambling hall
The waitress babysat the boy at the bar, oh no
After an hour, Jimmy doubled his cash
He took his kid and his winnings as the dealer just laughed
He said they leave, but then they always come back, that's a fact
Out on the road, they caught a stranger in the lights
His thumb was up and his son asked if the man was alright
Jim said you never give a hitcher a ride 'cause it’s us or them
It was 3 AM
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

20 years gone and now the boy is a man
Broke Jimmy's habits, got in mountains and mountains of debt
And now the sharks are coming back to collect, oh-oh
They stripped his jewelry and the boots off Jim's feet
They kick him out of the car and say we'll give you a week
Eight miles from home and only 18 degrees
It was 3 AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

Now Jimmy's son is trying to make his way home
His graveyard shift had ended and it was starting to snow
He sees an old man walking barefoot alone
It was 3 AM
His old man waved his hands with tears in his eyes
But Jimmy's son just sped up and remembered daddy's advice
No, you don't ever give a hitcher a ride ’cause it’s us or them
'Cause it’s me or him
It was 3 AM, 3 AM3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Some days are diamonds
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden
And they fade away
But if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday

’Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down

All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the danger
It holds in the pain
Sometimes you’re happy
Sometimes you cry
Half of me is ocean
Half of me is sky
But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Yes, they do

Some things are over
Some things go on
Part of me you carry
And part of me is gone

But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Baby, you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Held on to hope like a noose, like a rope
God and medicine take no mercy on him
Poisoned his blood, and burned out his throat
Enough is enough, he's a long way from home

Days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
Who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
I flew far away, as far as I could go
Your time is running out
And I'm a long way from home

Laid up in bed, you were laid up in bed
Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home

Hospital gowns never fit like they should
We yelled at the nurse, didn't do any good
“More morphine”, the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
That you weren't far away from home2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You're gonna leave, it ain't gonna break my heart, mama
I've never seen nobody quite like you

And if you ever change your tune
Oh, the world's got the best of you
You can always find me where the skies are blue

Wanted to change, turn into what you love, mama
And I woulda gave all of my best to you

So, if you ever need a fool
Who will give you a love so true
You can always find me where the skies are blue

Lay your dreams, little darlin', in a flower bed
Let that sunshine in your hair, in your hair

You're gonna bleed somebody's brand new love, mama
Who's gonna feel just like it always do
And when your fairytale is through
And you're looking for someone new
You can always find me where the skies are blue
You can always find me where the skies are blue1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Singing to myself
Singing for the neighbours
Holdin' on for work
Holdin' on to paper
I was on the left
You were only fading
I was on my own
Starin' at the ceiling
Hold, holdin' out
Read it on a map
Never how I planned it
Holdin' on for work
Taking it for granted
I was looking up
I was being blinded
Holdin' on for work
Hopin' that I'd find it
I was looking up
Holding on to patience
Counting up the days
Days that I'd been waiting
You can take your time
I'll be on the front porch
Keepin' on the light
You can see it if you look for it
I would lie awake at night
Hopin' that one day I'd run
I had waited all my life
I was holdin'

Is it me and you? Or is it me and the moon?11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I didn't need another push towards the edge
But you did it with a casual stance
My constitution, my confidence
They left me when you did
And now I'm asking

Who are you?
Who are you?

I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?

I'm not the human that I could have been
Instead I gave my heart to a breathing machine
Where there's no heartbeat and I'm freezing
And you don't care
(You just leave)
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)

Oh, maybe I'm depressed, or maybe I know too much
About the world, about myself

 Beautiful idiot
Why am I in love with you?
Stupid joke did you in
Here we go again
And if your nose was bleeding I would tell you
It's a stupid party anyway
You'll always be stupid
So I'll always be there

I don't want to lose you
I just want to kiss you

I promise you
I'll fight for your life
All through the night
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
Through the end of time
I promise you
I'll fight for your life

We barely made it out alive
And now we're on a train tonight
A different city, a different life
Will it ever feel right?
Oh, why am I complaining?
'Cause this feels so right
I don't want to lose you
I just want to kiss you

 It's too hard to begin
When you know it will end
And if you've got a friend
You better leave with him

When everyone wants to dance, I can't stand up
I know that I need love
But I can't pretend, I can't pretend

One day the moon will set for the last time
Maybe we'll become part of a mountain
We've always learned these things
You know I'm not crying
But you know I'm not trying to care
It's too hard to begin
When you know it will end
And if you've got a friend
You better leave with him
When everyone wants to dance, I can't stand up
I know that I need love
But I can't pretend, I can't pretend
I can't pretend
Remember when you first touched my hand
We sparkled inside at the same time
And now it doesn't even matter
It's too hard to begin
When you know it will end
And if you've got a friend
You better leave with him
When everyone wants to dance, I can't stand up
I know that I need love
But I can't pretend, I can't pretend
I can't pretend

Oooooooh

I see us high, high on a mountain
I see us die, dying in a mountain

 Hi
Hi
Welcome
Who's this?
Jonny
Oh, okay, just checking
Shrink-wrapped magazines in a paper bag
He hugged me when I came home
Only boy in a ballet class
He hugged me when I came home
Dad's on the pulpit talking about love
Mum's in the nursery cussing me out
He hugged me when I came home
Jean was crazy but she loved me
When she died I slept in her car
He hugged me when I came home
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me
Get the best of me
Have a headache?
We'll grab the oil
If you complain
Well, thats the devil talking
He hugs me when I come home
Your sister got married fourteen times
But if you fall in love, son, that's a crime
He hugs me when I come home
Well I fell in love and told them I was happy
My dad hugged me and said this would be the last hug
This would be the last hug
This would be the last hug
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me
Get the best of me
Philip took me out for pizza in London
He said they were his friends and they weren't mine
Philip took me for a walk in New York City
Please hug me when I come home
He told me my story was boring
He told me my story was boring
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories

And we wrote a new one everyday

 Take a little walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat
With a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand
You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the Bowery and the slums
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper
In his red right hand


You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed
By his red right hand

 Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darling one
The cleaners are coming one by one
You don't even want to let them start
They are knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts
Oh-Oh-O Children
Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag

O Children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning
Oh-Oh-O Children
We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
It's round about and it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings

O Children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
And they're lining up to inspect you
Oh-Oh-O Children
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that we lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
Hey, little train, we are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
Hey, little train, wait for me!
I once was blind, but now I see
Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?
Hey little train, wait for me!
I was held in chains, but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see?
In this process of elimination
Hey little train, we are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation
Hey little train, we are all jumping on

 I don't believe in an interventionist God
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did, I would kneel down and ask Him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Oh, not to touch a hair on your head
Leave you as you are
If he felt he had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder if that's true
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch over you
To each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

But I believe in Love
And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candles burning
And make her journey bright and pure
That she will keep returning
Always and evermore

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 You fell from the sky
Crash landed in a field
Near the River Adur
Flowers spring from the ground
Lambs burst from the wombs of their mothers
In a hole beneath the bridge
You convalesced, you fashioned masks of twigs and clay
You cried beneath the dripping trees
Ghost song lodged in the throat of a mermaid

With my voice
I am calling you

You're a young man waking
Covered in blood that is not yours
You're a woman in a yellow dress
Surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds
You're a young girl full of forbidden energy
Flickering in the gloom
You're a drug addict lying on your back
In a Tijuana hotel room

With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you
You're an African doctor
Harvesting tear ducts
You believe in God
But you get no special dispensation for this belief now
You're an old man sitting by the fire
You're the mist rolling off the sea
You're a distant memory in the mind of your creator
Don't you see?

With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you
Let us sit together until the moment comes

 They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

From the first day I saw her, I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

On the second day, I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I've seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"
On the second day, he came with a single red rose
He said, "Give me your loss and your sorrow"
I nodded my head as I lay on the bed
If I show you the roses, will you follow?

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

On the third day, he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

 When you're feeling like a lover, nothing really matters anymore
I saw you standing there in the supermarket
With your red dress falling and your eyes are to the ground
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters when the one you love is gone

It's still in me, baby I need you
In my heart, I need you

Cause nothing really matters
I'm standing in the doorway
You're walking 'round to my place
In your red dress, hair hanging down
With your eyes on one, we love the ones we can
Cause nothing really matters when you're standing

Standing
I need you, need you

Cause nothing really matters
We followed the lines in the palms of our hands
You're standing in the supermarket
Nothing, holding hands
In your red dress, falling, falling in, falling in
The long black cars waiting 'round
I will miss you when you're gone
I'll miss you when you're gone away forever
Cause nothing really matters
I thought I knew better, so much better
And I need you
I need you

Cause nothing really matters
Oh the night we wrecked like a train
Purring cars in the pouring rain
Never felt right about it, never again
Cause nothing really matters
Nothing really matters anymore
Not even today, no matter how hard I try
When you're standing in the aisle
And baby, nothing, nothing, nothing

I need, I need, I need you
I need you, I need you
Just breathe, just breathe

 Sunday morning, skeleton tree
Well, nothing is for free
In the window, a candle
Well, maybe you can see
Fallen leaves thrown across the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire
Nothing is for free

I call out, I call out
Right across the sea
But the echo comes back empty
And nothing is for free

Sunday morning, skeleton tree
Pressed against the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire

I call out, I call out
Right across the sea
I call out, I call out
Nothing is for free
And it's alright now
And it's alright now
And it's alright now2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Nick Cave the Bad Seeds, 
 Upside down and inside out and on all eights
Like a funnel-web, like a black fly on the ceiling
Skinny, white haunches high and skyward
And her black oily gash crawling backwards across the carpet to smash all over everything
Her wet, black fur against the sun going down
Over the shops and the cars and the crowds in the town

And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she does and this is what she is

Her eyes that look at me through her rainy hair
Are two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in
Her body, moon blue as a jellyfish
And I'm breathing deep and I'm there and I'm also not there
And spurting ink over the sheets, but she remains, completely unexplained
Or maybe I'm just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain
I thought slavery had been abolished
How come it's gone and reared its ugly head again?

And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
And this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she is and this is what she does
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
And this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
Then this is what she does and this is what she is
And now she's jumping up with her leaping brain
Stepping over heaps of sleeping children
Disappearing and further up and spinning out again
Up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed
Up and out of the bed and down the hall where she stops for moment and turns and says
"Are you still here?"
And then reaches high and dangles herself like a child's dream from the ring of Saturn3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Some go on, some stay behind, some never move at all
Girl in amber, trapped forever, spinning down the hall
Let no part of her go unremembered, clothes across the floor
Girl in amber, long does slumber shuts the bathroom door

The phone, the phone, the phone it rings, it rings, it rings no more
The song, the song, the song it spins since 1984
The phone, the phone, the phone, it rings, the phone, it rings no more
The song, the song, it's been spinning now since 19...

If you want to bleed, just bleed (Ah)
And if you want to bleed, just bleed (Ah)
And if you want to bleed, don't breathe a word
Just step away
And let the world spinning now

You turn, you turn, you kneel, lace up his shoes, your little blue-eyed boy
Take him by his hand, go moving spinning down the hall
I get lucky, I get lucky 'cause I tried again
I knew the world it would stop spinning now since you've been gone
I used to think that when you died you kind of wandered the world
In a slumber till you crumbled, were absorbed into the earth
Well, I don't think that any more
The phone it rings no more
The song, the song it spins, it spins now since 1984
The song, the song, the song it spins, it's been spinning now
And if you'll hold me I will tell you that you know that

If you want to leave, don't breathe (Ah)
And if you want to leave, don't breathe (Ah)
And if you want to leave, don't breathe a word
And let the world turn

The song, the song it spins, the song, it spins, it spins no more
The phone, it rings, it rings
And you won't stay

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Don't touch me (Ah)
Don't touch me (Ah)
Don't touch me (Ah)
Don't touch me2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Nick Cave the Bad Seeds, 
 It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Death Row
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know
And I'll say it again
I am not afraid to die

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
Of An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die
Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog
The walls are bad
Black, bottom kind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say
It seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand I
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of His Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like the moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
So I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
But I'm not afraid to die

The mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is a-melting
And in a way I'm helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway, I saw no proof
And not a motive why
And the mercy seat is a-melting
And I think my blood is boiling
And in a way I'm spoiling
All the fun by all of this consequence and truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And nor a motive why

And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof

Artist:Nick Cave the Bad Seeds, 
 Mostly I never knew which way was out
Once it was on, it was on and that was that
The umbilicus was a faucet that fountained rabid blood
And I spun on my wheel like a laboratory rat

I was an electrical storm on the bathroom floor, clutching the bowl
My blood was full of gags and other people's diseases
My monstrous little memory had swallowed me whole
It was the year I officially became the Bride of Jesus

In love, in love, in love you laugh
In love you move, I move
And one more time with feeling
For love, you love, I laugh, you love
Saw you in half
And the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh, the urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming
I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues
And I had a sudden urge to become someone, someone like you
Who started out with less than anyone I ever knew
In love, in love, I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I move, you move
And one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I'm sawn in half
And all the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh and oh, you come shyly, softly to the hole to drink
Come as far as the edge of my blood, and then swim
And in the bathroom mirror I see me vomit in the sink
And all through the house we hear the hyena's hymns

Of love, I love, you love, I love, you love
I laugh, you laugh, I move, you move, you move
And one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
We saw each other in half
And all the stars are splashed and splattered across the ceiling2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Let us go now, my one true love
Call the gasman, cut the power out
We can set out, we can set out for the distant skies
Watch the sun, watch it rising in your eyes

Let us go now, my darling companion
Set out for the distant skies
See the sun, see it rising
See it rising, rising in your eyes

They told us our gods would outlive us
They told us our dreams would outlive us
They told us our gods would outlive us
But they lied

Let us go now, my only companion
Set out for the distant skies
Soon the children will be rising, will be rising
This is not for our eyes6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards
Stagger Lee
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old Stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, he had payments on that
Stagger Lee
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, "Never ever come back no more
Stagger Lee"
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee
He said "Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am"
The barkeeper said, "No, and I don't give a good goddamn"
To Stagger Lee
He said, "Well bartender, it's so plain to see
I'm the bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee
Mr. Stagger Lee"
Barkeep said, "Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day
Mr Stagger Lee"
Well ah, those were the last words that the barkeep said
Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Known to make more money than any bitch in town
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she startin' to flirt
Oh, Stagger Lee
She saw the barkeep, said, "O God, he can't be dead!"
Stag said, "Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head!"
She said, "You ain't look like you scored in quite a time
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime
Mr. Stagger Lee!"
"But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in
Mr. Stagger Lee"
"I'll stay here till Billy Dilly comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy Dilly in his motherfucking ass"
Said Stagger Lee
"I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get to one fat boy's asshole!"
Said Stagger Lee
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, "You must be
The mad motherfucker called Stagger Lee"
"I'm Stagger Lee
Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead"
Said Stagger Lee
Well, Billy Dilly dropped down and slobbered on his head
And Stag filled him full of lead
*gunshots*
Oh yeah

 On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Bea
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down, the Russians moved in
Now I'm too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past
She used to say:
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Here they ought to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Street
Ah, look at me now


The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well, a girl’s gotta make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a fetus on a leash
I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
The curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I’m transforming, I’m vibrating, I’m glowing
I’m flying, look at me now
I’m flying, look at me now

 (Ooh)
(Ooh, oh)

The bright horses have broken free from the fields
They are horses of love, their manes full of fire
They are parting the cities, those bright, burning horses
And everyone is hiding, and no one makes a sound
And I'm by your side, and I'm holding your hand
Bright horses of wonder springing from your burning hand

(Ooh)
(Ooh, oh)

And everyone has a heart and it's calling for something
And we're all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are
And horses are just horses and their manes aren't full of fire
The fields are just fields and there ain't no Lord
And everyone is hidden, and everyone is cruel
And there's no shortage of tyrants and no shortage of fools
And the little white shape dancing at the end of the hall
Is just a wish that time can't dissolve at all
(Ooh)
(Ooh, oh)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, this world is plain to see
It don't mean we can't believe in something
And anyway, my baby's coming back now on the next train
I can hear the whistle blowin', I can hear the mighty roar
I can hear the horses prancing in the pastures of the Lord
Oh, the train is coming, and I'm standing here to see
And it's bringing my baby right back to me
Well, there are some things that are hard to explain
But my baby's coming home now on the 5:30 train6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Can't remember anything at all
Flame trees line the streets
Can't remember anything at all

But I'm driving my car down to Geneva

I've been sitting in my basement patio
Aye it was hot up above
Girls walk past, their roses all in bloom
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson Blues?
I'm going down to Geneva, baby
Gonna teach it to you
Who cares?
Who cares what the future brings?

Black road long and I drove and drove
And came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson with a 10-dollar guitar
Strapped to his back looking for a tune
Ah, well here comes Lucifer with his canon law
And a hundred black babies running from his genocidal jaw
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil, man
Don't know who is gonna rip off who
Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singing the Higgs Boson Blues
I'm tired, I'm looking for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped
In Memphis now in the Lorraine Motel
It's hot, it's hot - that's why they call it the Hot Spot
I'll take a room with a view
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yeah
And making the hot cots in the flophouse bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
And a bellhop hops and bops
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues

And if I die tonight
Bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
That the caliphate forced on the Jews
Ah, can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat?

Hannah Montana does the African Savannah
As the simulated rainy season begins
She curses the queue at the zoo loos
And moves on to Amazonia
And cries with the dolphins
Mau Mau ate the pygmy
The pygmy ate the monkey
The monkey has a gift
That he is sending back to you
Look, here comes the missionary
With his smallpox and flu
He's saving them, the savages
With his Higgs Boson Blues
I'm driving my car down to Geneva
I'm driving my car down to Geneva

 All the fine wind is gone
And this sweet world is so much older
The animals pull the night around their shoulders
The flowers fall to their naked knees
Here I come now, here I come
I hear you been out there looking for something to love
There's a dark force that shifts at the edge of the trees
It's alright, it's alright
Well, you've turn so long and lovely, it's hard to believe
That we're falling now in the name of the Anthrocene

Oh the things we love, we love, we love, we lose
It's our bodies that fall when we're trying to rise
And I hear you been out looking for something to love
Sit down beside me and I'll name it for you
Behold, behold, the heaven-bound seas
The wind cast its shadow and it moves through the trees
Behold the animals and the birds and the sky entire
I hear you've been out there looking for something to set on fire
The head-bowed children fall to their knees
Humbled in the age of the Anthrocene

Here they come now, here they come, pulling you away
There are powers at play more forceful than we
Come over here and sit down and say a short prayer
A prayer to the air, to the air that we breathe
And the astonishing rise of the Anthrocene
Come on now, come on now
Hold your breath while you say
It's a long way back and I'm begging you please
To come home now, come home now
Well, I heard you been out looking for something to love
Close your eyes, little world and brace yourselfEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Here we go

There goes the moonlit man
Got a suitcase in his hand
He's moving on
Down the road
Things tend to fall apart starting with his heart
He kisses you lightly and he leaves
Leaves your sleeping body
Curled and dreaming around your smile, your smile
The three bears watch the TV
They age a lifetime, O' Lord
Mama bear holds the remote
Papa bear, he just floats
And baby bear, he has gone
To the moon in a boat, on a boat

I'm speaking about love now
And how the lights of love go down
You're in the back room washing his clothes
Love's like that, you know, it's like a tidal flow
And the past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go
Won't ever let you go

If I could move the night I would
And I would turn the world around if I could
There's nothing wrong with loving something
You can't hold in your hand
You're sitting on the edge of the bed
Smoking and shaking your head
Well there's nothing wrong with loving things
That cannot even stand
Well there goes your moony man
With his suitcase in his hand
Well every road is lined with animals
That rise from their blood and walk
Well the moon won't get a wink of sleep
If I stay all night and talk
If I stay all night and talk3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Once there was a song, the song yearned to be sung
It was a spinning song about the king of rock 'n' roll
The king was first a young prince, the prince was the best
With his black jelly hair he crashed onto a stage in Vegas

The king had a queen, the queen's hair was a stairway
She tended the castle garden and in the garden planted a tree
The garden tree was a stairway, it was 16 branches high
On the top branch was a nest, sing the high cloudy nest
In the nest there was a bird, the bird had a wing
The wing had a feather, spin the feather and sing the wind

The king in time died, the queen's heart broke like a vow
And the tree returned to the earth with the nest and the bird
But the feather spun upward, upward and upward
Spinning all the weather vanes
And you're sitting at the kitchen table, listening to the radio

And I love you, and I love you, and I love you, and I love you
And I love you, and I love you, and I love you
Peace will come, a peace will come, a peace will come in time
A time will come, a time will come, a time will come for us
Peace will come, a peace will come, a peace will come in time
A time will come, a time will come, a time will come for us1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'd love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Yet I seemed so obsolete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

She had a heart full of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come and find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you
All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you
(Do you love me?)

 All through the night we drove, and the wind caught her hair
And we parked on the beach in the cool evening air
Well, sometimes it's better not to say anything at all
Your body is an anchor, never asked to be free
Just want to stay in the business of making you happy
Well, I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you

A priest runs through the chapel, all the calendars are turning
A Jesus freak on the street says, "He is returning"
Well, sometimes a little bit of faith can go a long, long way
Your soul is my anchor, I never asked to be freed
Well, sleep now, sleep now, take as long as you need
'Cause I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you to return

 The fires continued through the night
The kid with a bat face appeared at the window then disappeared into the headlights
I was halfway to the Pacific Coast
I had left you in your longing and your yearning like a ghost
There's little room for wonder now, and little room for wildness too
We crawl into our wounds, I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
I'm gonna buy me a house up in the hills
With a tear-shaped pool and a gun that kills
Cause they say there is a cougar that roams these parts
With a terrible engine of wrath for a heart
That she is white and rare and full of all kinds of harm
And stalks the perimeter all day long
But at night lays trembling in my arms

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my place in the sun
And I'm just waiting now, for peace to come

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And we hide in our wounds and I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
And I know my time will come one day soon
I'm waiting for peace to come
And I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
Oh babe we're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run
Halfway down the Pacific Coast
Well I left you sleeping like a ghost in your wounds
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Somewhere, don't know
Now I'm standing on the shore
All the animals roam the beaches
Sea creatures rise out of the sea
And I'm standing on the shore
Everyone begins to run
The kid drops his bucket and spade
And climbs into the sun

Kisa had a baby, but the baby died
Goes to the villagers, says "My baby's sick!"
Villagers shake their heads and say to her
"Better bury your baby in the forest quick"

It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind

Kisa went to the mountain and asked the Buddha
"My baby's sick!" Buddha said, "Don't cry"
"Go to each house and collect a mustard seed
But only from a house where no one's died"
Kisa went to each house in the village
"My baby's getting sicker", poor Kisa cried
But Kisa never collected one mustard seed
Because in every house, someone had died
Kisa sat down in the old village square
She hugged her baby and cried and cried
She said everybody is always losing somebody
Then walked into the forest and buried her child
Everybody's losing someone
Everybody's losing someone
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for peace to come
For peace to come1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Artist:Nick Cave the Bad Seeds, 
 Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in apt. 29
Why? That's the one right up top a mine
I start to cry, I start to cry
Oh, I hear her walkin'
Walkin' barefoot cross the floor-boards
All through this lonesome night
And I hear her crying too
Hot-tears come splashin' on down
Leaking through the cracks
Down upon my face
I catch 'em in my mouth!
Walk and cry, walk and cry

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

I read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizing every little piece of dirt
Tore out a page and stuffed it inside my shirt
Fled outta the window
And shinning it down the vine
Outta her nightmare
And back into mine
Mine! O Mine!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Cry! Cry! Cry!

She's wearing them bloo-stockens, I bet!
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen I know it must sound absurd
But I can hear the most melancholy sound I ever heard!
Walk and cry, kneel and cry!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

Oh tell me why? Why? Why?
Why the ceiling still shakes?
Why the fixtures turn to serpents snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound
And it's naggin' at me like a shrew
But I know, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her
O o o then ya know
That lil girl would just have to go!
Go! Go!
From her to eternity!4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I see you, you see me
How pleasant, this feeling
The moment you hold me
I missed you, I'm sorry
I've given what I have
I showed you I'm growing
The ashes fall slowly
As your voice consoles me

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
We're swaying to drum beats
In motion, I'm feeling
My patience controlling
The question, I won't speak
We're telling the stories
Our laughter, he knows me
We're leaving, we're talking
You're closer, it's calming

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
The night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Take me alive
Leave me to die
Bound to this earth
This isn't goodbye

Cut through the heart
Mangle my veins

I need you to kill me

 It’s taking over me, it’s taking everything I have
To keep myself from wanting to be apart of you
Inside my ailing mind I bribe myself to think that
I am made for you what can I do for us to make it through

I know it’s hard to see the wounds inside of me
I’m hiding underneath all my suffering
And even if I cry I’ll never close my eyes
To see through all the lies you bestowed to me
When all is clarity the hate you gave to me
With all sincerity hurts like a disease
The wings that brought you here will take you far and near
But you will always be no angel to me

You fill me with distrust
I’m writhing in disgust as I am told another person has loved you till it hurt
I want to seep inside, I want to sleep beside you when
Your heart depends on stranger’s lust just to feel alive

I know it’s hard to see the wounds inside of me
I’m hiding underneath all my suffering
And even if I cry I’ll never close my eyes
To see through all the lies you bestowed to me
When all is clarity the hate you gave to me
With all sincerity hurts like a disease
The wings that brought you here will take you far and near
But you will always be no angel to me
I know it’s hard to see the wounds inside of me
I’m hiding underneath all my suffering
And even if I cry I’ll never close my eyes

 In my time alone I died a million deaths
A gaze into the glass to memories I have kept
They show me who I’ve been, the people I have hurt
I lay myself to sleep, my power will emerge

Don’t you ever cry for me
You could never tell me you’re sorry
Get me far away from here (From liquid I’m drowning)
As my body leaves a void
Fill it up with memories that I’ve destroyed
Burden me with hate and love (From liquid I’m choking)

I used to have a heart with pain I never felt
I tried to fall apart for damage I have dealt
Through the broken glass my kingdom underneath
The mirror looking back, a monster made of me

Don’t you ever cry for me
You could never tell me you’re sorry
Get me far away from here (From liquid I’m drowning)
As my body leaves a void
Fill it up with memories that I’ve destroyed
Burden me with hate and love (From liquid I’m choking)
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Don’t you ever cry for me
You could never tell me you’re sorry

 (Of all the times, the chances I have given you, you let me down)

On the first I won’t forget the way you said
"He took his life and left the line dead"
How do you think selfishly?
You made me hurt so vacantly

You let me down and I know it’s all because of me
You let me down and I know it’s all because of me (cause of me)
Of all the times, the chances I have given you, you let me down

When I emerge I will forgive
The choice that led to giving up but never know why
A hollow void — you keep me there
I’ll drown in tears until you care

You let me down and I know it’s all because of me
You let me down  and I know it’s all because of me (cause of me)

 I was alone on my way home
My footsteps slow, someone walks close behind me
I lose my breath by hands of death
He hit my head, this body's fallen lifeless
Carry me through to somewhere new
Why am I here? I do not know these people
I'm calling home, let it be known
I'm with a friend, I'm not in any danger

44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day
Please save me from reckless, violent hearts
Bodies rest in graves of cold concrete

They woke me up, pain in my gut
With several cuts, these boys are mindless demons
I'm losing blood, the fear they lust
Memories are dust, no one can hear me crying
This lonely room, I call my tomb
A falling moon
How will they choose to end me?
Before my eyes a fire lights
My body dies
Hell will engulf me slowly
44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day
Please save me from reckless, violent hearts
Bodies rest in graves of cold concrete

44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day

 I don’t mind being underneath you
If you need something to do I am ready to be used
I don’t mind being overwhelmed
You can hurt me to the core, I’ll always ask you for more
I don’t mind taking all your rage
You’ve been down this road before It’s my job to misbehave
I don’t mind taking all the blame
You assert the dominance, I will always know my place

When you do these things to me who am I supposed to be?
If I don’t reciprocate will you let my body break?

I won’t hurt you like before, you’ll be pleading on the floor
You don’t mind taking all my rage
I’ll go down this road again just to let you feel the pain
You don’t mind taking all the blame
As you serve your master well, you will always know your place

 To all my friends I got a blade
A sedative, the rope tied
Thanks for everything from the love below
Put my finger on the trigger and I’ll let it go
Electricity at my fingertips
A gas leak in case that I forget
I’ve got all I need to get me out of here
Leave me be with my remorse and I will disappear

I want to hurt myself, I want to hurt myself
I want, I want, I want to hurt myself, I want to hurt myself
I want to hurt myself, I want to hurt myself
I want, I want, I want to hurt myself, I want to hurt myself

Hurry up, take me today
It always ends the same way
My head won’t clear when I lose control
Please don’t wake me up if I become comatose
Does it hurt if you know
That I’m not here, you’ll be alone
I surrender now I won’t leave a note
Let me jump, let me shoot, let me overdose
I want to hurt myself, I want to hurt myself

Looking for ones to trust
I realized my mistake
It's too much for me to take

The rope around my neck will make my prescence known
The gun held to my head will show how much I've grown
The knife that's in my back will leave your heart to roam
As pleasure turns to pain, I'll be alone
I'll be alone

Normally I will fall
To stay clean, to fix it all
I have been through your hell
Bury me when you are well

 When we first met I fell apart
You carved the words inside my heart
It hurts to breathe when I’m alone
It hurts to be unknown

We’ve got our own grave with both names It’s do or die
I can’t hear you but I can feel you — you’re by my side
To feel the time move the hues that paint you you can’t hide
We’ve got our own grave with both names it’s you and I

Somehow, somewhere it’s in the air
I’m in your arms, I’m in your care
Across the floor our hearts are strewn
Exchanging touch my wounds are sewn

We’ve got our own grave with both names It’s do or die
I can’t hear you but I can feel you — you’re by my side
To feel the time move the hues that paint you you can’t hide
We’ve got our own grave with both names it’s you and I

Every night I try to reach you, there's never a reply
If there's a way I can see you, I am ready to die
We’ve got our own grave with both names It’s do or die (It’s do or die)
I can’t hear you but I can feel you — you’re by my side (you’re by my side)
To feel the time move the hues that paint you you can’t hide (you can’t hide)

My nerves unravel
It hurts to hide myself from you
With care I held it
Inside I felt it
My favorite pain comes back to me

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you

These blades I'm hiding
Keep safe the tidings
Of bridges crossed that soon collapsed
No fear of falling
Endlessly calling
You make me feel like I'm alone

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you

It’s hard to say when this is all a game
With guilt and shame I'll never be the same
Give me something else to do cause I'm about to go insane
The "king of hearts" your favorite card to play
You win them all and break them in a day
It’s all my fault with nothing left to gain
Take this stupid halo off so you can see through my charade

Trauma, trauma I think I'm dying inside
I don't want to be alive
Trauma, trauma I think I hurt myself again
I don't know where to begin

You grip me tight I told you let me go
And as I cried the scars begin to show
With all my rage I'm gonna take you down
To watch you beg and plead before I put you in the ground
Shut your mouth don't play it like we're cool
For my revenge I'll break all of the rules
I hope you rot Inside a shallow grave
This is all that you deserve there is no need to give me praise

You're not the one I wish to be
Tell your friends that I'm gone
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To find me
Tell your friends that I'm dead
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To mourn me
A woman cries alone
Her child just a stain
Mind of eroding stone
She will get hurt again
Resist the urge to perfect thee
Create the curse you live to see
Swallow the boy's ejected seed
You're not the one I wish to be
Tell your friends that I'm gone
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To find me
Tell your friends that I'm dead
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To mourn meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 At this time
Put the knife
In your chest
Take your life
Candlelight
Burning bright
Guide your eyes
Through the night

Open your third eye
See through my disguise
Turn the truth to lies
X I I I
Let your demons die
When you sleep at night
I'll be your demise

On my neck
Banish those

On my hands
Spirits dance

 This part of me you cannot see
It’s tightly tied to my demise
I’ve built inside, A paradise
For those who see with clarity
I’ll show you my reality
With confidence, I will confide

No matter how hard I have tried
I gave you up, I died inside
It’s you, and I and my weak side
No matter how hard I have tried
I gave you up, I died inside
It’s you, and I and my weak side

I shed a tear but does it help
A human form will be my shell
I give myself, It’s all for you
You give me purpose in a way
I’ll grant your wish, do as you say
My modesty begins to fade

No matter how hard I have tried
I gave you up, I died inside
It’s you, and I and my weak side
No matter how hard I have tried
I gave you up, I died inside
It’s you, and I and my weak side
No matter how hard I have tried
I gave you up, I died inside
It’s you, and I and my weak side
No matter how hard I have tried
I gave you up, I died inside
It’s you, and I and my weak side1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Twelve  o' clock at night
I'm nowhere in sight
No I will not fight
I must do what's right

At times I feel I'm dying
I know I am not alone
They want me to quit trying
Suicide over the phone
Please tell them I am okay
I do not wish to be here
One day I'll finally conquer
Till then just forgive me dear

Nights have been too rough
Weak and out of luck
I have had enough
I would kill for love

At times I feel I'm dying
I know I am not alone
They want me to quit trying
Suicide over the phone
Please tell them I am okay
I do not wish to be here
One day I'll finally conquer
Till then just forgive me dear

Artist:Mr. Kitty, 
 In a field of flowers I will pass the time
Counting all the reasons I must say goodbye
With my heart in ruins all the roses die
I will make it through this and I’ll tell you why

You showed me dying can be beautiful
When the clock stops moving and the earth is full
Both my eyes are drenched in darkness I’ll no longer see
All the things that hurt me I’ll no longer breathe

I can feel the sunlight leave the atmosphere
Everything around me slowly disappeared
I will not forget you, now I’m on my own
All my pain lie dormant, I will let you know

You showed me dying can be beautiful
When the clock stops moving and the earth is full
Both my eyes are drenched in darkness I’ll no longer see
All the things that hurt me I’ll no longer breathe

I wouldn’t be here If it wasn’t for you
I couldn’t be there to save yourself from you
Now my wings feel heavy but I have to prove
This is all for you, I did it all for you
You showed me dying can be beautiful
When the clock stops moving and the earth is full
Both my eyes are drenched in darkness I’ll no longer see
All the things that hurt me I’ll no longer breathe
You showed me dying can be beautiful
When the clock stops moving and the earth is full
Both your eyes have closed to sleep now, you are finally free
Nothing left to hurt you, may you rest in peace1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 It's not goodnight, this is goodbye
I cannot promise I’ll see the light
I will miss you with all my heart
I'll give you now to tear apart

I know a place Inside of me
That I never want to be
I needed time, how can't you see
Something is taking over me
This is the end I don’t believe
There is anything for me
Into the dark final retreat
I'll take the bullet through my teeth

When you grieve do you believe
All your tears will summon me?
By space around that should be
With lungs of stone I forgot to breathe

I know a place Inside of me
That I never want to be
I needed time, how can't you see
Something is taking over me
This is the end I don't believe
There is anything for me
Into the dark final retreat

Promise me you will see

To your goodbye, to your regrets
You still have time, you’re not dead yet
Promise me you will see

Don’t forget this is genocide
Give back their prayers
You can make this right

There are no survivors
They will visit, but they can’t hear you

 From hearts of blue I dream of you
To isolate and decimate
I'll clear my head
These thoughts I dread
You'll never see the ghosts of me
Amethyst tears, forgive my fears
With eyes so bleak what do you seek?
And when we die the doves will cry
Glaciers will fall once and for all

Your shadow on my skin
A feeling that's within
We'll let the shake begin
Just let me take you in
This house is not a home
Don't let me be alone
My heart will die again
And you will never know

Inside my chest I felt a void
It grows with time 'till I'm annoyed
When things were right I wasn't scared
But now it's gone, my feelings rare
It reminds me
I didn't care
For anyone
I wouldn't dare
I'm hiding now inside the earth
Just waiting for a new rebirth
Your shadow on my skin
A feeling that's within
We'll let the shake begin
Just let me take you in
This house is not a home
Don't let me be alone
My heart will die again
And you will never know
Your shadow on my skin
A feeling that's within
We'll let the shake begin
Just let me take you in
This house is not a home
Don't let me be alone
My heart will die again
And you will never know
Your shadow on my skin
A feeling that's within
We'll let the shake begin
Just let me take you in

 All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

 Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (Ah)

I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you

And you could call this the funeral

And you can play this at my funeral
Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin
Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain
I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?
Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah
R.I.P. to my youth

Mama, there is only so much I can do
Tough for you to witness but it was for me too

Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock
When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop
When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop
I was naive and hopeful and lost
Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, woah
What do I do? What do I do?
I don't believe it if I don't keep proof
I don't believe it if I don't know you
I don't believe it if it's on the news or on the Internet
I need a cigarette

 We talked about making it
I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me just to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason
It killed you like diseases
And I can hear it in your voice while you're speaking
You can't be treated
Mr. Know-it-all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all

If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

He told me I should take it in, listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking
As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
Well, I can tell the wires pulled
If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

I'm having trouble in believing
And I just started seeing
Light at the beginning of the tunnel
But he tells me that I'm dreaming
When he talks I hear his ghosts
Every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming

If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes

I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
You're too pretty for me
Baby, I know, it's true, yeah
You look better when you first wake up
Than anybody else I've fucked
Baby, I got good luck with you

I didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (Ay)

Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooo, yeah, I need you here, oh
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me

Drivin' through the city with me
Just watching you glow
I'm in the passenger seat, you're in control
It's on you now, mhm
You look better every day, I swear
Really, it's a little unfair

If we fall apart
Maybe it wasn't meant to be
If we fall apart
Then it was our favorite dream

 Lost and afraid, young and innocent but getting older
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
Sharper the blade is, the easier it scars your soul
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone

My current state is heavy
Hope it's a phase or something

Don't let me go

Up and away, I'm an alien, I need a moment
I don't know what to believe
All I wanna do is leave
What can I say that would make you see, make you need me?
Maybe I won't ever know, maybe I'll end up alone

Running in place (Circles, in circles with you)
Don't mind me, out in a race (I didn't mean to be here)

Watch me go
I don't wanna let you down
So, promise you won’t let me drown
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
I got some mixed emotions about how I've been getting to all these checks
Acting all funny because of the money
It's making my tummy upset
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
Somebody find me a balance
Look what I did to myself and my friends
Emotions are paying the rent, oh
Emotions are paying the rent, oh

I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati-

 Hope you don't regret it
I pushed a lot back but I can't forget it
We never got the credit
Nobody seemed to hear us but we said it
Neither of us planned it
And for a long time I took it all for granted
I really thought we had it
But at the time it was more than I could manage, so

If we can leave it all behind us
And meet in between
It would get me so

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

Wish I didn't doubt it
I wish I never ever told you all about it
But I just had to let you know
I never meant to hurt you, though
I had all my motives
I didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions
I just had to reach my goals
Never knew I'd meet you though, so
If we can agree to disagree
And keep on reaching
It would get you so

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

We should stick together
You're my best friend, I'll love you forever (Would you come with me?)
(It would get you so)
We could be the greatest, it doesn't matter if we're never rich or famous (Would you come with me?)
(It would get you so)

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

If you can just let me know if it's okay
To call you when I'm lonely67EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 She was five foot four with some money on the floor
And a box that's hidden under her bed
I was only 22 with a pocket full of truth
But I gave her everything that I had
We were born and raised in the Golden State
Mommy's gone and daddy's doing his best
I was brought up great, living Section 8
Social security's paying the rent, ohh
The landlord called, she said "you gotta go"
Little one, you just lost your—

Yeah
She was five foot four, getting money on tour
But her socks were at the end of my bed
Got our names tattooed on each other
Just to prove to each other that we'd do what we said
Only took a few days till our minds were made up
And we thought we should try it again
I was only 17 when we first tried things
When she first made me feel like a man, ohh

Who am I gonna call?
Who's gonna catch me when I—
Who's the one you're sleeping with?
Well, don't just sit in front of me and wait for me to talk
You can call me up, phone works two ways, you know
This time, baby, yeah, I think that I'll be just fine
And I wish I could say the same for you

To those of you in which I choose to always be the closest to
There's something that you need to know: loving me is not a joke
And you can put it all on me, you can laugh and you can bleed
And I'll adopt it all because that's what a buddy does
I loved you from minute one, the iced tea to my lemonade
Never one to hit and run, soaking every minute made
You can give me all your juice, I can squeeze it out for you
And all I ask you in exchange, love me back through every phase
If it ever comes off wrong or leaves you with a bitter taste
Just remember you're the tea
And I'm your sour lemonade, I'm your sour lemonade
Tropical iced tea and hot pink lemonade20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 I need you to fill the void
I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

Started with a little bit
Now I don't know how to quit
Always feel inadequate
Same way that my daddy did
Mama told me not to try
And I should have taken her advice
And now I'm all twisted
When it's all gone, I miss it

I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'
Else that gets me through the day
'Til I find another way
I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'
Even if I lose again
I won't quit
I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once, uh
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

And now I need you to feel the vibe
I need you to see the point
I need you to feel alive
I need you to fill the void

My insecurities are
My own worst enemy, yeah
Something's not lettin' me
Move the way I used to
Thought you could better me but
Then you stopped lettin' me walk
Now you're just settin' me off
So I'm tryna lose you

I'll fight just to do somethin'
I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'
Else that gets me through the day

 Maybe I shouldn't try to be perfect
I confess, I'm obsessed with the surface
In the end, if I fall or if I get it all
I just hope that it's worth it
Last year I fell flat on my face
And last month I knew somethin' should change
Last week I started over again
Ask me and I'll tell you how I've been
Mhm, don't get me started

You've got me nervous to speak
So I just won't say anything at all
I've got an urge to release
And you keep tellin' me to hold on
You've got me nervous to move
So I just won't give anything to you
You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Should I be quiet?
Uh, come on, be silent
Uh, you know I'm tryin'
So don't say nothin'
Uh, tell me you trust me and
Kiss me and hug me, yeah
Well, I would do anything for ya
You just gotta love me and
I got an itch in my throat
I don't know which way to go
I keep on switchin', I know
I need a different approach
It's all because I wanna
Show you that I'm so capable

Hush, baby, don't you say another word, be quiet
Hush, baby, don't you say another word
Hush, baby, when you do, I just get hurt

Come on, baby, don't you hurt me anymore
I'm not the same way that I was before
I got goosebumps all over me
When you're around, hard for me to breathe
Come on, baby, don't you do that anymore, mhm
It's not like the days have never felt so short
My nerves, they give me a sign
Tell me I'm not fine, mhm

 I think I found help
I think I found something
I think I found something in my TV screen
I think I found out that I have nothing
That I have nothing in this place for me
I watched it all in my head, perfect sense
They'll take me from my bed
Leave everything that is worth a single cent
And just take me instead
That TV show I saw as I fell asleep
Had me on both my knees
Praying to whatever is in heaven, please send me a felon
And don't let the police know

Anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please
Anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please, oh

I think I can tell
I think I can tell them
Tell them they were made for me
I'm thinking they'll know, know it already
I'm thinking they'll know just about everything
I bet they planned it all out like the shows
Went everywhere I go
Walked in the store right behind me
Stood in line right beside me and followed me to my home
I'm sure they figured it out, early on
That I would never run
That they could shoot but that's no fun
'Cause then they're killing the stolen son
Oh, anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please

Hands up, it's a stick up
Nobody's leaving this room for a minute
Everyone's breathing these fumes that are in it
Sick of the people who make the decisions
Put your hands up, it's a stick up
Hopefully God is still down to forgive us
Nobody's breathing, who let the evil in?

What's in the water?
Are you bothered?
What's the problem here?

 Jump onto new streets, jump onto new streets
Jump onto new streets, jump onto new streets (Ah)
Jump onto new streets, jump onto new streets

Me, I'm from a different type of left land
Old wild west land
Nose bleeds, palm trees and tumbleweeds rustling
Outside they say it's happy here but it's depressing
Too many pretty faces catching my attention
So I look at them
Remind myself in this smudged glass
That pretty isn't everything, you punk-ass
Always hard to see past the surface when it looks so perfect
But our eyes will disguise dirt on purpose, you listening?
I grew up here under the sun
In grade school, I was the odd one out of the bunch
And I don't mean I was the kid to eat bugs for lunch
I was the one who wasn't coming from where they're coming from (Uh)
I speak poetically and never pride my ignorance
But this California shit is rigorous
They say it's happy here, happiness is figurative
I'm happy 'cause of me, doesn't matter where I'm living

If the sun was God, I'd be covered in faith
If the ocean was the devil, I'd be covered in hate
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm waking up underneath sheets, naked, still sweating
Slept in late so everybody else is ready
My friend called up, he said
"Hurry up, buddy, it's almost sundown already"
So I hopped up, I went and washed up
I ate some pasta then I gave my mom hugs
And then I thought, uh
It's gonna be a pretty nice night
(But pretty isn't everything, right?)
Golden state mind (Mind)
I'm taking my time (Time)
Plain white shirt and a skinny black tie
My top let down when I get picked up
PCH, so California
Maybe they were right, happiness is a warm gun
But before you shoot please warn us
Life is too fun, California, will you marry me?
Let God be the sun and in the ocean they shall bury me

If the sun was God, I'd be covered in faith
If the ocean was the devil, I'd be covered in hate
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so west coast, it's a goddamn shame

Kaleidoscope, but that's only half the time
Three days before she told me that I don't even try

Maybe you're right, maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?

Four weeks ahead, I thought that I should think some more
I'm fucked in the head, and my mind is turning into a whore

We made it pretty far on the first try
Might've set the bar a little too high, yeah
It started with a spark now we're on fire

Ooh-ooh, baby
You take me on a ride
Gonna drive me crazy
Ooh-ooh, baby
I feel like we've made it pretty far
Now we're stargazing

Ooh-ooh, baby
I feel like we've made it pretty far15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Dirty fingernails, same as your mind
But he could strum the guitar just fine
Every now and then he'd think about his life
Daydreamin' just to pass the time

Now the sun is closer than it was before
Anyone who's anyone can feel it

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
They keep on using me

Even as a child everyone would say
He was gonna be a star someday
Finally he found a way to reach the sky
But he didn't know what he'd find

Now the sun is closer than it was before
Anyone who's anyone can feel it, mmm

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
They keep on using me
He's got a big head full of trash
And he talks down every chance he gets
He's a grown man with committable mistakes

Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
They keep on using me61EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 How could you question God's existence
When you question God himself?
Why would you ask for God's assistance
If you wouldn't take the help?

If you're gone then I need you
If you're gone then how is any of this real?
When I'm on I believe you
When I'm not, my knees don't even seem to feel

How could you tell me that I'm great
When they chewed me up, spit me out and pissed on me?
Why would you tell me that it's fate
When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

They say the end is coming sooner
But the end's already here
I said today is but a rumor
That we'll laugh at in a year
Or two, or three, or four, or five, whatever

If you're gone then I need you
If you're gone then how is any of this real?
When I'm on I believe you
When I'm not, my knees don't even seem to feel
How could you tell me that I'm great
When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?
Why would you tell me that it's fate
When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?
How could you tell me that I'm great
When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?
Why would you tell me that it's fate
When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

How?
How could you tell me that I'm great?
How?
How could you tell me that it's fate?
How?36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
